    "Sklearn pipelines allow you to stitch together multiple components of a machine learning process. The idea is that you can pass you raw data and get predictions out of the pipeline. This ability to pass raw input and receive a prediction from a singular class makes pipelines well suited for production, because you can pickle a a pipeline without worry about other data preprocessing steps. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Note:* Each time we call the pipeline during grid search, each component is fit again. The vectorizer (tf-idf) is transforming our entire vocabulary during each cross-validation fold. That transformation adds significant run time to our grid search. There *might* be interactions between the vectorizer and our classifier, so we estimate their performance together in the code below. However, if your goal is to reduce run time. Train your vectorizer separately (ie out of the grid-searched pipeline). "

The Zoroastrian doctrine of the Savior of\\n the Future (Saoshyant) was the basis for the story of the coming of the Magi\\n to Bethlehem in the _Gospel of Matthew_ (2:1-12).]\\n\\n  The Old Persian word magu, rendered in Greek by magos, is of uncertain \\netymology. It may originally have meant \"member of the tribe,\" as in the\\nAvestan compound mogu-tbish (\"hostile to a member of the tribe\"). This meaning\\nwould have been further resticted, among the Medes, to \"member of the priestly\\ntribe\" and perhaps to \"priest\" (Benveniste, 1938; Boyce, 1982). The term is\\nprobably of Median origin, given that Herodotus mentions the \"Magoi\" as one of\\nthe six tribes of the Medes.\\n  For a variety of reasons we can consider the Magi to have been members of a\\npriestly tribe of Median origin in western Iran. Among the Persians, they were\\nresponsible for liturgical functions, as well as for maintaining their\\nknowledge of the holy and the occult. Most likely, the supremacy of the Median\\npriesthood in western Iran became established during the time of the Median\\nmonarchy that dominated the Persians from the end of the eighth century\\nthrough the first half of the sixth century BCE until the revolt of Cyrus the\\nGreat (550 BCE). The Persians were indebted to the Medes for their political\\nand civil institutions as well. Even if hypotheses have been advanced\\nconcerning the existence of Magi of Persian origin in the Achaemenid period\\n(Boyce, 1982), we must still maintain that they were of Median origin. This is\\ndemonstrated by the eposide of the revolt of Gaumata the Magian, mentioned by\\nDarius I (522-486 BCE) in the inscription at Bisutun (Iran), as well as by\\nGreek sources. Indeed, Herodotus insists on the idea of the usurpatory power of\\nthe Medes against the Persians through the conspiracy of the Magi.\\n  The fact that the Magi may have been members of a tribe that handed down the\\nsacerdotal arts in a hereditary fashion naturally did not exclude the\\npossibility that some of them undertook secular prefessions. This seems to be\\nattested by the Elamite tablets at Persepolis.\\n  There is a theses, put forth by Giuseppe Messina, that denies that the Magi\\nare members of an ethnic group by suggesting that they are simply members of\\nthe priesthood - a priesthood of purely Zoroastrian origin. This thesis is\\nuntenable; on the other hand, the hypothesis that their name is related to the\\nAvestan term magavan, derived from the Gathic maga (Vedic, magha, \"gift\"), is\\nnot without foundation (Mole, 1963). The meaning of maga can probably be found,\\nin conformity with the Pahlavi tradition, within the context of the concept of\\npurity, or separation of the \"mixture\" of the two opposed principles of spirit\\nand matter. The maga, which has been erroneously interpreted as \"chorus,\" from\\nthe root mangh, which is said to mean \"sing the magic song\" (Nyberg, 1966) and\\nhas been rendered simply by an expression like unio mystica, seems to be an\\necstatic condition that opens the mind to spiritual vision. In any case, though\\nthere may be a relation between the Old Persian term magu and the Avestan terms\\nmagavan and maga, we must maintain a clear distinction between the Magi and the\\nAvestan priesthood. The Avesta ignores the Median or Old Persian term, despite\\na recent hypothesis proposed by H.W. Bailey; Old Persian inscriptions ignore\\nthe Avestan term for \"priest,\" athravan (Vedic, athravan), even if this is \\nperhaps present in an Achaeminid setting in the Elamite tablets of Persepolis \\n(Gershevitch, 1964).\\n  The term magu has been present in Zoroastrianism throughout its history; the\\nPahlavi terms mogh-mard and mobad represent its continuation. The latter in\\nparticular derives from an older form, magupati (\"head of the Magi\"). During\\nthe Sasanid period (third to seventh centuries CE), which saw the formation of\\na hierarchically organized church, the title mobadan mobad (\"the high priest of\\nhigh priests\") came to be used to designate the summit of the ecclesiastical\\nhierarchy.\\n  The Magi practiced consanguineous marriage, or khvaetvadatha (Av.; Pahl.,\\nkhwedodah). They also performed a characteristic funeral rite: the exposure of\\nthe corpse to animals and vultures to remove the flesh and thereby cleanse it.\\nThe corpse was not supposed to decompose, lest it be contaminated by the demons\\nof putrefaction. This practice later became typical of the entire Zoroastrian\\ncommunity and led to the rise of a complex funeral ritual in Iran and among the\\nParsis in India. Stone towers, known as dakhmas, were built especially for this\\nrite. During the time of Herodotus the practice of exposure of the corpse was\\nin vogue only among the Magi; the Persians generally sprinkled the corpse with\\nwax, then buried it. The practice was widespread, however, among the peoples\\nof Central Asia.\\n  The Magi were the technicians of and experts on worship: it was impossible to\\noffer sacrifices without the presence of a Magus. During the performance of a\\nritual sacrifice, the Magus sang of the theogony (the Magi were possibly the\\ncustodians of a tradition of sacred poetry, but we know nothing about the\\nrelationship of this tradition to the various parts of the Avesta) and was\\ncalled upon to interpret dreams and to divine the future. The Magi were also\\nknown for the practice of killing harmful, or \"Ahrimanical,\" animals (khrafstra)\\nsuch as snakes and ants. They dressed in the Median style, wearing pants,\\ntunics, and coats with sleeves. They wore a characteristic head covering of\\nfelt (Gr. tiara) with strips on the sides that could be used to cover the nose\\nand mouth during rituals to avoid contaminating consecrated objects with their\\nbreath (Boyce, 1982). The color of these caps, in conformity with a tradition\\nthat is probably of Indo-European origin, according to Georges Dumezil, was\\nthat of the priesthood: white.\\n  In all likelihood, during the Achaemenid period the Magi were not in\\npossession of a well-defined body of doctrine, and it is probable that they\\ngradually adopted Zoroastrianism; they were most likely a clergy consisting of\\nprofessional priests who were not tied to a rigid orthodoxy but were naturally\\ninclined to eclecticism and syncretism. Nonetheless, they must have been\\njealous guardians of the patrimony of Zorastrian traditions. By virtue of this\\nthey were the educators of the royal princes. The wisest of them was responsible\\nfor teaching the prince the \"magic of Zarathushtra, son of Horomazes\" and thus\\nthe \"cult of the gods.\" Magi who excelled in other virtues were entrusted with\\nthe education of the prince so that he would learn to be just, courageous, and\\nmaster of himself.\\n  During the Achaemenid period the Magi maintained a position of great\\ninfluence, although they were certainly subordinate to the emperor. Despite\\nseveral dramatic events such as the massacre they suffered after the death of\\nGaumata the Magian - in which, according to Herodotus (who calls himself\\nSmerdis), the Persians killed a large number of Magi to avenge the usurpation -\\nthe Magi nevertheless managed to maintain their influence at court in Media,\\nin Persia, and in the various regions of the empire where they were stationed\\nas a consequence of the Persian civilian and military administration.\\n  No priesthood of antiquity was more famous than that of the Magi. They were\\nrenowned as followers of Zarathushtra (Zoroaster); as the teachers of some of\\nthe greatest Greek thinkers (Pythagoras, Democritus, Plato); as the wise men\\nwho arrived, guided by a star, at the manger of the newborn savior in\\nBethlehem; and as the propagators of a cult of the sun in India. But they were\\nalso known as the Chaldeans, the priesthood of Babylon, known for its occultism;\\nthis was perhaps the reason that the term magos had a pejorative sense in Greek,\\nlike \"goes,\" \"expert in the magic arts\" (Bidez and Cumont, 1938). Indeed, the\\nChaldeans were experts in all types of magical arts, especially astrology, and\\nhad a reputation for wisdom as well as knowledge.\\n  To understand the reasons for such various and sometimes discordant views, it\\nis necessary to distinguish between the Magi of Iran proper and the so-called\\nwestern Magi, who were later hellenized. In the Achaemenid period both must\\nhave been at least in part Zoroastrian, but the western Magi (those of the\\nIranian diaspora in Asia Minor, Syria, Mesopotamia, and Armenia), who came in\\ncontact with diverse religious traditions, must have, sooner or later and in\\nvarying degrees, been influenced by syncretic concepts.\\n  The Greeks were familiar with both kinds of Magi and, depending on their\\nvarying concerns, would emphasize one or the other aspect of them. Classical\\nhistorians and geographers, including Herodotus and Strabo, document their\\ncustoms, while the philosophers dwell above all on their doctrines: dualism,\\nbelief in the hereafter, Magian cosmology and cosmogony, and their theology\\nand eschatology. Those sources most interested in the doctrines of the Magi\\neven speak of Zarathushtra as a Magus. In doing so they are repeating what the\\nMagi themselves said from the Median and Achaemenid periods, when they adopted\\nZoroastrianism. At that time they embraced Zarathushtra as one of their own and\\nplaced themselves under his venerable name.\\n  Zoroastrianism had already undergone several profound transformations in the\\neastern community by the time of the Acheamenids and was already adapting those\\nelements of the archaic religion that refused to die. It has been said quite\\noften, in an attempt to characterize the precise role of the Magi in the\\nZoroastrian tradition, that the Vendidad (from vi-daevo-data, \"the law-abjuring\\ndaivas\"), part of the Avesta, should be attributed to them. (This collection of\\ntexts from various periods is primarily concerned with purificatory rules and\\npractices.) Nonetheless, the hypothesis is hardly plausible, since the first\\nchapter of the Vendidad - a list of sixteen lands created by Ahura Mazda, the\\nsupreme god of Zoroastrianism, but contaminated by an attack by Ahriman (Pahl.;\\nGathic-Avestan, Angra Mainyu), the other supreme god and the ultimate source of\\nall evil and suffering - does not mention western Iran, Persia, or Media (the\\nland of Ragha mentioned in the text cannot be Median Raghiana). Furthermore, it\\nhas been noted (Gershevitch, 1964) that if the authors had been Magi the\\nabsence of any reference to western Iranian institutions, including their own\\npriesthood, would be very strange.\\n  The Magi were above all the means by which the Zoroastrian tradition and the\\ncorpus of the Avesta have been transmitted to us, from the second half of the\\nfirst millennium BCE on. This has been their principal merit. We can attribute\\ndirectly to the Magi the new formulation that Iranian dualism assumed, known to\\nus especially from Greek sources and, in part, from the Pahlavi literature of\\nthe ninth and tenth centuries CE. According to this formulation, the two poles\\nof the dualism are no longer, as in the Gathas, Spenta Mainyu (\"beneficent\\nspirit\") and Angra Mainyu (\"hostile spirit\") but Ahura Mazda himself and Angra\\nMainyu (Gershevitch, 1964). [See Ahura Mazda and Angra Mainyu.] This trans-\\nformation was of immense consequence for the historical development of Zoro-\\nastrianism and was most likely determined by the contact of the Magi with the\\nMesopotamian religious world. In this new dualism - which was that later known\\nto the Greeks (Aristotle, Eudemus of Rhodes, Theopompus, and others) - we can\\nsee the affirmation of a new current of thought within Zoroastrianism, to which\\nwe give the name Zurvanism. [See Zurvanism.]\\n  Thanks to their adherence to Zoroastrianism, the Magi played an enormously\\nimportant role in the transmission of Zarathushtra\\'s treachings, as well as in\\nthe definition of the new forms that these would assume historically. Their\\nnatural propensity to eclecticism and syncretism also helped the diffusion of\\nZoroastrian ideas in the communities of the Iranian diaspora. The Greeks began\\nto study their doctrines and to take an interest in them (Xanthus of Lydia,\\nHermodorus, Aristotle, Theopompus, Hermippus, Dinon), even writing treatises\\non the Persian religion, of which only the titles and a few fragments have\\nsurvived. In the Hellenistic period, the Magi were seen as a secular school of\\nwisdom, and writings on magic, astrology, and alchemy were lent the authority\\nof such prestigious names as Zarathushtra, Ostanes, and Hystaspes, forming an\\nabundant apocryphal literature. (Bidez and Cumont, 1938).\\n  Later still, eschatology and apocalyptics were a fertile meeting\\nground for Iranian and Judeo-Christian religions, as can be seen in the famous\\n_Oracles of Hystaspes_, a work whose Iranian roots are undeniable and which\\nmost likely dates from the beginning of the Christian era, probably the\\nsecond century CE (Widengren, 1968). The Zoroastrian doctrine of the Savior of\\nthe Future (Saoshyant) was the basis for the story of the coming of the Magi\\nto Bethlehem in the _Gospel of Matthew_ (2:1-12). [See Saoshyant.]\\n  The Sasanid period saw the Magi once again play a determining role in the\\nreligious history of Iran. Concerned to win back the western Magi (de Menasce,\\n1956), and eager to consolidate Zoroastrianism as the national religion of\\nIran, the priests of Iranian sanctuaries in Media and Persia were able to\\nestablish a true state church, strongly hierarchical and endowed with an\\northodoxy based on the formation of a canon of scriptures. The leading figures\\nin the development of a state religion and of Zoroastrian orthodoxy were Tosar\\nand Kerder, the persecutors of Mani in the third century.\\n\\nSAOSHYANT:\\n  The Avestan term saoshyant (\"future benefactor\"; MPers., soshans) designates\\nthe savior of the world, who will arrive at a future time to redeem humankind.\\nThe concept of the future savior is one of the fundamental notions of Zoro-\\nastrianism, together with that of dualism; it appears as early as in the Gathas.\\nZarathushtra (Zoroaster), as the prophet of the religion, is himself a Sao-\\nshyant, one who performs his works for the Frashokereti, the end of the present\\nstate of the world, when existence will be \"rehabilitated\" and \"made splendid.\"\\n[See Frashokereti]\\n  Later Zoroastrian doctrine developed this notion into a true eschatological\\nmyth and expanded the number of Saoshyants from one to three. All the saviors\\nare born from the seed of Zarathushtra, which is preserved through the ages in\\nLake Kansaoya (identified with present-day Lake Helmand, in Seistan, Iran),\\nprotected by 99,999 fravashis, or guardian spirits. The greatest of the awaited\\nSaoshyants, the victorious Astvatereta (\"he who embodies truth\"), the son of\\nthe Vispataurvairi (\"she who conquers all\"), is the third, who will make\\nexistence splendid; he appears in Yashts 19. Upon his arrival humankind will\\nno longer be subject to old age, death, or corruption, and will be granted\\nunlimited power. At that time the dead will be resurrected, and the living will\\nbe immortal and indestructable. Brandishing the weapon with which he kills the\\npowerful enemies of the world of truth (that is, the world of the spirit, and\\nof asha), Astvatereta will look upon the whole of corporeal existence and\\nrender it imperishable. He and his comrades will engage in a great battle with\\nthe forces of evil, which will be destroyed.\\n  The name Astvatereta is clearly the result of theological speculation\\n(Kellens, 1974), as are those of his two brothers, Ukhshyatereta, \"he who makes\\ntruth grow,\" and Ukhshyatnemah, \"he who makes reverence grow\"; the names of the\\nthree virgins (Yashts 13) who are impregnated with the seed of Zarathushtra\\nwhen they bathe in Lake Kansaoya and give birth to the Saoshyants, are equally\\nspeculative. Each of these Saoshyants will arrive at the beginning of a\\nmillennium, initiating a new age and a new cycle of existence; Astvatereta will\\nappear in the third and final millennium to save mankind.\\n  The doctrine of the future savior had already taken shape in the Archaemenid\\nperiod (sixth to fourth century BCE). It was not, perhaps the principal element\\nin the formation of the messianic idea, but it was certainly a determining\\nfactor, one that enjoyed great success in the Hellenistic period beyond the\\nconfines of the Iranian world. A similar concept, that of the future Buddha,\\nMaitreya, was most likely indebted to it, and Christian messianism can trace\\nits roots to the same source.\\n',\n",

Americans have become so insensitive to the needs\\nof others and so completely wrapped up in themselves that they cannot see\\nstraight or think clearly enough to make even the slightest and most obvious\\nmoral decisions based on reality.\\n\\nIf a man abandons a woman to care for their child on her own, he is not\\nconsidered to be a very respectable or decent man by anyone.  This man has\\nfled his responsibility, has behaved like a lazy coward, and has turned\\naway from his responsibility to his wife and child.\\n\\nHowever, if a woman decides to kill her unborn child to release her burden,\\nshe is not thought of in the same way.  When the man abandons, the woman\\nsuffers but the child is free to grow up and live a happy and normal life.\\nWhen the woman abandons, the child is diced or killed with saline or vacuumed\\nout, and the man has no choice, and the man sometimes suffers so badly that\\nhe wishes he could trade places with his child.\\n\\nThs root of this whole problem is selfishness--the arrogance that says, \"My\\nfeelings and desires are supreme and your well being is not worth dung.\"\\nAnd when you come down to it, this is the substance of what hell is made of.\\nIt\\'s the reason a loving God can throw selfish people to the devil and his\\ndemons for all of eternity.

The only\\n\"responsibility\" that sells in the marketplace is that which is just\\nenough to make us \"feel responsible\" without showing anything that\\nmight show us our own true irresponsibility.

I used \"best\" in part to indicate \\nthat science currently has a time of it with why and who, so these domains are\\nmostly ignored.  I also attempted to be brief, which no doubt confused the\\nmatter.  As an aside, for science I should have written \"how and when\".  Nobody\\nseems to argue over what.\\n\\n>Are they [theists, theologians] any better equiped to investigate the \"who and \\n>why\" than magicians, astrologers, housewives [not being sexists], athiests or \\n>agnostics.\\n\\nSeems to me that the answer would vary from individual to individual.  I\\'m not\\ntrying to be evasive on this, but from a societal perspective, religion works.\\nOn the other hand, sometimes it is abused and misused, and many suffer, which\\nyou know.  But the net result seems positive, this from the anthropological\\nperspective on human affairs.  You might call me a neo-Fruedian insofar as I \\nthink the masses can\\'t get along without religion.  Not that generally they are \\nincapable; they just don\\'t, and for myriad reasons, but the main one seems to \\nbe the promise of immortality.  Very seductive, that immortality.  Therefore \\nit seems that theologians are better equipped than the others you mention for \\ndispensing answers to \"who and why\".  I suggest that this holds regardless of \\nthe \"truth\" in their answers to who and why simply because people believe.  \\nIn the end, spiritual beliefs are just as \"real\" as scientific facts and \\nexplanation (CAUTION TO SOME: DO NOT TAKE THIS OUT OF CONTEXT).  \\n\\n>Do you suggest that the \"who and why\" will forever be closed to scientific \\n>investigation?\\n\\nNo.  In fact, I don\\'t think it is closed now, at least for some individuals. \\nIsn\\'t there a group of theoretical physicists who argue that matter was \\ncreated from nothing in a Big Bang singularity?  This approach might \\npresuppose an absence of who and why, except that it seems it could be argued \\nthat something had to be responsible for nothing?  Maybe that something doesn\\'t\\nhave to be supernatural, maybe just mechanistic.  But that\\'s a tough one for\\npeople today to grasp.  In any case, theory without empirical data is not \\nexplanation, but then your question does not require data.  In other words, \\nI agree that theorizing (within scientific parameters) is just as scientific \\nas explaining.  So the answer is, who and why are not closed to scientists, but \\nI sense that science in these realms is currently very inadequate.  Data will \\nbe necessary for improvement, and that seems a long way off, if ever.  Pretty \\nconvoluted here; I hope I\\'ve made sense.  \\n\\n>It seems to me that 200 or so years ago, the question of the origin of life on\\n>earth was not considered open to scientific enquiry.\\n\\nI agree generally.  But I prefer to put it this way - the *questions* of how, \\nwhen, who and why were not open to inquiry.  During the Enlightenment, \\nreason was reponsible for questioning the theological answers to how and when, \\nand not, for the most part, who and why.  Science was thus born out of the \\nnaturalists\\' curiosity, eventually carting away the how and when while largely \\nleaving behind the who and why.  The ignorant, the selfish, the intolerant, and\\nthe arrogant, of course, still claim authority in all four domains.\\n\\n>|>Rich Fox, Anthro, Usouthdakota\\n\\n>Did like your discussion around AMHs, and I did figure out what AMH was from\\n>your original post :-)\\n\\nMuch obliged.

A point I saw reiterated was that\\nHitler and the party covered up these accusations. If you are going to accuse\\nofficial history of being a fabrication, you should at least get your facts\\nright. The pretext for purging Roehm was that he was planning to use the SA in\\na coup against Hitler. Nowhere is there mention of using allegations of\\nhomosexuality as a pretext for the purge, nor as a justification afterwards (it\\nis possible that the histories I\\'ve read have not mentioned this, but I doubt\\nit - would it be in Hitler\\'s best interest to admit to the world that his\\nformer right hand man was a homosexual?). \\n\\nAnyway, as I said before, it is always possible that I have missed references \\nto the Nazis making use of charges of homosexuality against the SA after the \\nnight of the long knives - but this does not prove that they were false.

In any case, \\nthis does not deal with accusations of homosexuality in the SA during the \\n1920\\'s.\\n\\n>Since the accusers thereafter controlled the records,\\n>anything bearing on the subject -- true or not -- has to be considered\\n>tainted evidence. \\n\\nAh, yes. I forgot this was being posted to alt.conspiracy. I can smell the\\nparanoia from here. Since the Nazis never officially charged Roehm with \\nhomosexuality (at least, not according to what I\\'ve read), I\\'d like to know \\nwhat tainted \"evidence\" you are talking about. Since the accusations were made \\nby persons outside of the Nazi party, long before it came to power, and those \\naccusations were common knowledge to journalists and others in Germany in the \\n1920\\'s and 30\\'s, just how would it be possible for the Nazis to go back in \\ntime and plant \"tainted\" evidence? How exactly does one doctor newspapers \\nwhich were circulated around the world, without the discrepancies being \\nobvious? What actual incidences of Nazi doctoring evidence on this matter\\ndo you know about? And what about the testimony of people who were involved in \\nthese matters, some of whom were not Nazis? And what is the point of making a \\nfalse accusation of homosexuality if you do not publicize it? Since the point \\nhere seems to be to discredit established history, then the burden of proof \\nfalls on the revisionist. The revisionists had better do their homework \\nbefore making accusations. Otherwise they simply look like conspiracy nuts.\\n\\n>The available data suggest that Roehm and his crowd,\\n>the SA -- Sturmabteilung, \"Storm Troopers\" -- left the world a better\\n>place when they departed, \\n\\nThis is just about the *only* thing we agree on. \\n\\nI suspect that the notion that there might have been bad people - Roehm and \\nhis SA buddies - who were homosexuals must disturb some people. The feeling\\nseems to be that if a nasty individual is accused of homosexuality, that this\\nmust be an attempt to bash homosexuals. This fear - often justified - is what\\nlies behind this distrust of official history, or so it seems to me. But this\\nis not a good justification for trashing accepted accounts of this subject. If \\nyou really think that historians are so incompetent, why don\\'t you write them \\nand ask where they got their sources on this subject, if you can\\'t tell from \\ntheir footnotes?

The Children of\\nIsrael were given a very strict set of Moral, Civil, Judicial and Ceremonial\\nLaws to follow and yet this was clearly not enough to cover every instance\\nof moral dilemma in their Society. For a Christian, the situation is no better.\\n\\nIt seems to me that the only code of morality that we have from the Judeo-\\nChristian God is that which is contained in the Bible (which we can see from\\nthe diverse opinions in the Christian newsgroups is not clear). There may well\\nbe an absolute morality defined by the Judeo-Christian God for mankind to\\nfollow but it seems that we only have a subset simply because the concept was\\nwritten down by man.\\n\\nThis leads to the problem of defining morality for our society. If we take the\\ndivine Morality then we have a code of practice which may be interpreted in many\\ndifferent ways (as an example, consider the immolation of heretics in the\\nfifteenth century and the interpretation of the Bible which allows a man to do\\nthat to another man under the precept to administer Justice). If we take an\\nagnostic Morality then we have a code of practice that can be modified to suit\\nsociety (with all the danger that this implies). Alternatively, we could take\\nthe basis of the Judeo-Christian morality and interpret/extend this to create\\nand justify a code of morality which suits the society we live in and enables\\nthe people to live Righteously (as many Christian and Non-Christian philosophers\\nhave done).\\n\\nWhatever the driving force behind the definition of morality for our society, I\\nthink the important aspect is the result.\\n\\nDavid.\\n\\n---\\nOn religion:\\n\\n\"Oh, where is the sea?\", the fishes cried,\\nAs they swam its clearness through.\\n\\n',\n",

This excludes literalists, who may otherwise be\\ndefined as biblical apologists.  They find what they want to find.  They are\\nnot trustworthy by scholarly standards (and others).\\n\\nWhy an insert?  Read it - I have, a number of times.  The passage is glaringly\\nout of context, and Josephus, a superb writer, had no such problem elsewhere \\nin his work.  The passage has *nothing* to do with the subject matter in which \\nit lies.  It suddenly appears and then just as quickly disappears.\\n\\nUntil you can demonstrate how and why the scholarly community is wrong about\\nthe Josephus insert, your \"proof\" is meaningless and it should not be repeated\\nhere.  What\\'s more, even if Josephus happened to be legitimate, it would \"prove\"\\nnothing.  Scholars speak of the \"weight of evidence.\"  Far more independent\\nevidence would be required to validate your claim.  Until forthcoming, your\\nbelief is based on faith.  That\\'s OK, but you exceed your rights when you pass\\nfaith off as fact.\\n\\nAs for the gospels, there are parallels, but there are also glaring\\ninconsistencies and contradictions.  Shouldn\\'t a perfect canon be perfect? \\nShouldn\\'t there be absolutely no room for debate?  I suggest you read _Gospel \\nFictions_ by Randel Helms, and _The Unauthorized Version_ by Robin Fox (for \\nHerb Huston, no known kinship or familial relationship, but we do indeed share \\nan evolutionary ancestry).\\n\\nThe fact that there are inconsistencies, gaps and contradictions does not deny\\nyour position.  On the other hand, neither do the gospels \"prove\" your faith. \\nIndependent evidence is necessary, and I know of none (which we have already\\ndiscussed, and so far you have not provided any).  Until then, its faith. \\nMoreover, you have committed a fundamental error in logic.  You have attempted\\nto \"prove\" your claim with that which you want to prove.  Its no different than\\nsaying \"I am right because I say so.\"  \\n\\nYour logic is full of circles.  It reminds me a bit of the 1910 Presbyterian \\nGeneral Assembly.  The assembly defined five fundamentals (this is where\\n\"fundamentalist\" came from) of orthodox Protestant Christianity, to wit: 1)\\nJesus performed miracles, 2) Jesus was born of a virgin, 3) Jesus was bodily\\nresurrected, 4) Jesus\\' crucifixion atoned for human sin, and - here is the\\nclincher - 5) the bible is the inerrant word of God.  Presbyterians construe\\n\"inerrant\" broadly as spritually inerrant.  Fundamentalists take the\\nfirst four as literally true, and then validate them with a literally inerrant\\nbible, which contains the first four, and which is the only thing known to \\ncontain the first four.  \\n\\nSmoke and mirrors and wands and hand waving if ever there was!\\n\\nIts faith, Bill.

I challenged him to provide\\nthe details of that logic that led him to an incorrect conclusion.\\nToday we find another obscure article (posting it twice didn\\'t help\\nmake it more clear, Jim), titled \"Inductive Logic\":\\n\\n>Scenario:\\n>A white goose waddles past the door\\n>A white goose waddles past the door\\n>A white goose waddles past the door\\n>...( repeat an uncountably large number of times)...\\n>A black goose waddles past the door.

If ONLY black geese are observed to be axed, is it not a valid question \\n>   to be concerned with the different behavior between black and white geese?\\n\\nMore red herrings.  Could Jim mean that he has read an uncountably large\\nnumber of my articles?  Could Jim mean that because I \"axed\" his articles,\\nbut not Weiss\\' articles, he wants to conclude inductively ...\\nWell, I can\\'t see where he is going with this.\\n\\nBut I can help him with his induction.  I\\'ve written roughly 80\\narticles since January.  The vast majority of them are discussions with\\nFrank DeCenso and other inerrantists, where I take the position that\\nthey are making bad arguments.  Some are discussions with Jim Meritt\\nwhere I take the position that he is making bad arguments (a straw man\\nargument earlier, and taking quotes out of context more recently.)\\n\\nThink hard about this Jim.

Where do they come \\n#from?  The question came from the idea that I heard that morals come from\\n#whatever is societally mandated.\\n\\nIt\\'s only one aspect of morality.  Societal morality is necessarily\\nvery crude and broad-brush stuff which attempts to deal with what\\nis necessary to keep that society going  - and often it\\'s a little\\nover-enthusiastic about doing so.  Individual morality is a different\\nthing, it often includes societal mores (or society is in trouble),\\nbut is stronger.  For example, some people are vegetarian, though eating\\nmeat may be perfectly legal.\\n\\n#\\n#>#Merely a question for the basis of morality\\n#>#\\n#>#Moral/Ethical behavior = _Societally_ _acceptable_ _behavior_.\\n#>#\\n#>#1)Who is society\\n#\\n#>Depends on the society.\\n#\\n#Doesn\\'t help.  Is the point irrelevant?\\n\\nNo.  Often the answer is \"we are\".  But if society is those who make\\nthe rules, that\\'s a different question.  If society is who should\\nmake the rules, that\\'s yet another.  I don\\'t claim to have the answers, either,\\nbut I don\\'t think we do it very well in Ireland, and I like some things\\nabout the US system, at least in principle.\\n\\n#\\n#>#2)How do \"they\" define what is acceptable?\\n#\\n#>Depends.\\n#On....  Again, this comes from a certain question (see above).\\n\\nWell, ideally they don\\'t, but if they must they should do it by consensus, IMO.\\n#\\n#>#3)How do we keep from a \"whatever is legal is what is \"moral\" \"position?\\n#\\n#>By adopting a default position that people\\'s moral decisions\\n#>are none of society\\'s business,\\n#\\n#So how can we put people in jail? How can we condemn other societies?\\n\\nBecause sometimes that\\'s necessary.  The hard trick is to recognise when\\nit is, and equally importantly, when it isn\\'t.\\n\\n# and only interfering when it\\'s truly\\n#>necessary.\\n#\\n#Why would it be necessary?  What right do we have to interfere?\\n\\nIMO, it isn\\'t often that interference (i.e. jail, and force of various\\nkinds and degrees) is both necessary and effective.  Where you derive \\nthe right to interfere is a difficult question - it\\'s a sort of\\nliar\\'s paradox: \"force is necessary for freedom\".   One possible justification\\nis that people who wish to take away freedom shouldn\\'t object if\\ntheir own freedom is taken away - the paradox doesn\\'t arise if\\nwe don\\'t actively wish to take way anyone\\'s freedom.\\n#\\n#  The introduction of permissible interference causes the problem\\n#>that it can be either too much or too little - but most people seem\\n#>to agree that some level of interference is necessary.\\n#\\n#They see the need for a \"justice\" system.  How can we even define that term?\\n\\nOnly by consensus, I guess.\\n\\n#  Thus you\\n#>get a situation where \"The law often allows what honour forbids\", which I\\'ve\\n#>come to believe is as it should be.  \\n#\\n#I admit I don\\'t understand that statement.\\n\\nWhat I mean is that, while thus-and-such may be legal, thus-and-such may\\nalso be seen as immoral.

An atheist is one for whom all things can\\nbe understood as processes of nature - exclusively. There is no need\\nfor any recourse to Divnity to describe or explain anything. There is\\nno purpose or direction for any event beyond those required by\\nphysics, chemistry, biology, etc.; everything is random, nothing is\\ndetermnined.\\nThis would also have to include human intelligence of course and all\\nits products. There is nothing requiring that life evolve or that it\\nacquire intelligence, it\\'s just a happy accident. For an atheist, no\\nevent can be preferred to another or be said to have more or less\\nvalue than another in any naturalistic sense, and no thought -about-\\nan event can have value. \\nThe products of our intelligence are acquired from our environment,\\nfrom teaching, training, observation and experience and are only\\nsignificant to the individual mind wherein they reside. These mental\\nprocesses and the images they produce for us are just electrical\\nactivity and nothing more; content is of no consequence. The human\\nmind is as much a response to natural forces as water running down a\\nhill.\\nHow then can an atheist judge value? What is the basis for criticizing\\nthe values ennumerated in the Bible or the purposes imputed to God? On\\nwhat grounds can the the behavior of the reliogious be condemned? It\\nseems that, in judging the values that motivate others to action, you\\nhave to have some standard against which conduct is measured, but what\\nin nature can serve that purpose? What law of nature can you invoke to\\nestablish your values.\\nSince every event is entirely and exclusively a physical event, what\\ndifference could it possibly make what -anyone- does, religious or\\notherwise, there can be no -meaning- or gradation of value. The only\\nway an atheist can object to -any- behaviour is to admit that the\\nobjection is entirely subjective and that he(she) just doesn\\'t like it\\n- that\\'s it. Any value judgement must be prefaced by the disclaimer\\nthat it is nothing more than a matter of personal opinion and carries\\nno weight in any \"absolute\" sense.\\nThat you don\\'t like what God told people to do says nothing about God\\nor God\\'s commands, it says only that there was an electrical event in your\\nnervous system that created an emotional state that your mind coupled\\nwith a pre-existing thought-set to form that reaction. That your\\nobjections -seem- well founded is due to the way you\\'ve been\\nconditioned; there is no \"truth\" content. The whole of your\\nintellectual landscape is an illusion, a virtual reality.\\nI didn\\'t make these rules, it\\'s inherent in naturalistic atheism and\\nto be consistent, you have to accept the non-significance of any human\\nthought, even your own. All of this being so, you have excluded\\nyourself from any discussion of values, right, wrong, goood, evil,\\netc. and cannot participate. Your opinion about the Bible can have no\\nweight whatsoever.\\n\\nBill\\n',\n",

There are other sites which also carry news.answers postings.

(Last resort)  Mail mathew@mantis.co.uk, or post an article to the\\n   newsgroup asking how you can get the FAQ files.  You should only do this\\n   if you\\'ve tried the above methods and they\\'ve failed; it\\'s not nice to\\n   clutter the newsgroup or people\\'s mailboxes with requests for files.\\n   it\\'s better than posting without reading the FAQ, though!

None of this sounds like a \"small\\nfishing village\" by any stretch of the imagination.\\n\\nCenturies later, under the Abbasids, Tyre had \"opulent and flourishing\\nbazaars\" and buildings of 5-6 stories.

It notes that after Israel\\'s\\nwithdrawel in 1984, \"Tyre appeared to enjoy a revival of its local\\neconomy.\"\\n\\nIf Tyre is such an insignificant little fishing village at present,\\nwhy is it always called a city (or, above, a \"major city\")?

Gay people are and will\\ncon- tinue to be persecuted as long as such propaganda petpetuates.  You may\\nbe unaware of all the statistica \"findings\" concerning African-Americans that\\nhave been published and used by various groups to re-enforce their own bias\\nagainst African-Americans.  We usually think of the KKK in these instances,\\nbut there are many other groups.  Of course, the vast majority of the public\\nscoff at such findings and documents today, but that was not always the case.\\nFortunately African-Americans had \"whites\" who supported their \\'cause\\' and\\npublic sentiment was eventually (if not entirely) turned around.  There was\\neven a Civil War, and anti-negro sentiment increased.  In fact, until laws\\nwere put in place to protect the inalienable rights of Blacks it was pretty\\nmuch legal to discriminate against them.\\n\\nI know many gays and I will NOT turn my back on them or their right to be free\\nform discrimination.  You may think that I have been deceived or something,\\nthat is your perogative.  My church, Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)\\nopenly affirms the rights of oppressed people of all segments of society,\\nincluding gays.  We believe the Gospel message of preaching to all creation\\nand making disciples.  We believe in the Lord\\'s great commandment to Love,\\nand we beleive in standing up for the oppressed, even if it is not popular\\nto do so.  I really like my church for last reason the most.  I can find a\\nchurch almost anywhere in the valley that stands for the Gospel and believes\\nin the commandment of Love (though I\\'m hard-pressed to find many who actually\\nsho Love), but not many are willing to champion the oppressed, especially\\nwithin their own community.  I may have lost face with the greater Christian\\ncommunity for the unpopularity of my beliefs, but so did the abolitionists\\nagainst the oppression of African-Americans.  Many were even killed and\\ntreated as runaway slaves for being \"nigger-lovers\" and such.  I guess I\\'ve\\ndecided the challenge is worth it.\\n\\nIn my talks with gay men and women I have heard tragic story after tragic\\nstory centering around failed marriages, wives and husbands who are straight\\nwho have been hurt in the process, etc.  Funny thing is, I don\\'t know of one\\ncase where the parents, ex-wives, or even children have continued to reject\\ntheir gay family member (son, daughter, ex-husband, father, etc.) after they\\nbegan to take part in some form of support group, like PFLAG.\\n\\nI\\'m apalled by the legislation which passed in Colorado, and am equally out0\\nraged that such slimey people as Louis Sheldon (from the Tradition Values\\nCoalition) have been actively working in the Christian underground to garner\\nsupport within several (8 I believe) states this coming November for more\\noppressive legisation against gays.\\n\\nPerhaps you don\\'t get it, and maybe you never will.  Many didn\\'t get it in the\\nMiddle Ages and the proclaimed God\\'s will be done as they massacred thousands\\nin witch hunts and inquisitions.\\n\\nThe message that comes through, loud and clear, by proponents against gay\\nrights and against gays in general, is that there is a strong dislike, even\\nhatred for gays, whether you want to call it such or not (it doesn\\'t change\\nthe results).  The major flaw in all this posturing is that in the end, the\\nfinal effect of posts like that of yours and Mr. Hudson is that YOU have a\\n\"conditional\" love for gays.  Condition:  Change and we\\'ll love you. This is\\nsure strange coming from a group who claim that God has an \"unconditional\"\\nlove, one that calls people \"just as they are.\"  Sure there are things that\\nwill \\'naturally\\' change, and habits (like alcoholism, wife beating, etc.) that\\nneed to be changed through some sort of therapy.  But then there are things\\nlike left-handedness, etc. that no amount of beating it out of people, is\\ngoing to result in anything more than an outward conforminty to \"other\\npeople\\'s expectations.\" In the process this coerced conformity causes many\\npeople a great deal of harm, especially when it is caused by people who have\\nnothing more to gain from it that to become even more puffed up about their\\nown sense of pseuper-spirituality.\\n\\nThis is sad, but I thoroughly believe that one day it will change.  It may be\\nunpopular to cry for justice and equality when the basis has to do with\\nsomething very personal like \\'sexuality\\' (a taboo subject even today), but I\\nfirmly believe in the rights of individuals to be free from impose regulation\\non thier bedrooms.  It\\'s funny that most straight people have successfully\\nremoved restrictive and oppressive legislation against invasive legislation,\\nbut we like to maintain this little chestnut of repression...as though it\\nhelps us maintain a sense of superiority over at least one segment of society.\\nGay people are not criminals.\\n\\nAnother interesting thing happened recently.  A very prominent charismatic\\nchurch in the Silicon Valley (here) had two of it\\'s pastors arrested for self-\\nadmitted charges of pederasty (men having sex with boys).  This had apparently\\nbeen going on for some time (a couple years?), but since the charges were\\nvoluntary, and the church worked closely with the police, so I imagine that\\nwas how they managed to downplay it in the media.  How could such a thing\\nhappen when the church, itself, has an ex-gay ministry?  One of my friends\\nrecently told me he was \"approached\" by someone who is going through the\\nreparitive therapy there, and he was thoroughly convinced that the request for\\ndinner was not an invitation to attend the ministry.\\n\\nThese are difficult times we live in, but providing hostile environments and\\ncreating and perpetuating an atmosphere that breed hate and violence is not\\nthe call of the Christian community.  The results of the passing amendment in\\nColorado has created an organization who\\'s posters are appearing all over\\nColorado called \"S.T.R.A.I.G.H.T.\" (I forget the whole definition off hand,\\nbut the last part was Against Immoral Gross Homosexual Trash) and their motto\\nis \"Working for a fag-free America\" with an implicit advocation for violence.\\n\\nThis is sick, and it seems to be what you and Mr. Hudson, and others are\\nembracing.\\n\\nWe Christians have a LOOOOOOOOOONG tradition of coersion and oppression\\ntowards those we feel don\\'t \\'measure up\\', and constant beratement from\\norganizations like The Christian Research Institute, while they do have a good\\npurpose also, their major work seems to be finding new and better ways of\\nexcluding people.\\n\\nThe Gospel I believe is not so negative, rather it seeks ways to \"include\"\\npeople.  I have several of Dr. Martin\\'s books and find them quite helpful,\\nespecially concerning \\'cults.\\' But it seems that CRI, has become a cult unto\\nitself.

When he included that bit\\nfrom Merlinus X\\' he did us all a service.  He showed us the extremes\\nto which Order members have been known to go in their fervor.\\nI have little knowledge regarding Reuss\\' background, but surely\\nhe was an unusual man, and he was an important force in the Order \\nfor many years.\\n\\nYet as people change so do Orders change, and while we look back\\nso carefully at the dirty laundry of O.T.O. remember that this is\\nonly the surface skim and that many perspectives are now encompassed\\nwhich extend beyond any one individual.  I hope to show that there\\nwas and is much room for a difference of opinion within the Order\\nitself, perhaps by testing the limits myself.\\n\\n\\nLet us examine this issue a bit more closely....\\n\\n\"In 1895, Karl Kellner (1850-1905), a wealthy Austrian industrialist\\nand paper chemist, as well as a high-grade Mason, founded the Ordo\\nTempli Orientis.  Kellner had traveled widely in the East, where he\\nmet three adepts who instructed him specific magical practices.  \\nKellner\\'s efforts to develop the Order were later assisted by Franz\\nHartmann, Heinrich Klein and Theodore Reuss, who had worked together\\nprior to joining the O.T.O.  The Order was first proclaimed in 1902\\nin Reuss\\'s Masonic publication, \\'Oriflamme\\'.  On Kellner\\'s death,\\nReuss succeeded him as Outer Head [O.H.O.].  The \\'Jubilee\\' edition of\\nthe \\'Oriflamme\\', published in 1912, announced that the Order taught\\nsecret of sexual magic.\\n \\n\"Theodore Reuss was an interesting character.  Born June 28, 1855 in\\nAugsburg, he entered Masonry in 1876.  He was a singer, journalist and\\npossibly a spy for the Prussian political police, infiltrating the Socialist\\nLeague founded by Karl Marx\\'s daughter and her husband.  Reuss was\\nlater associated with William Wynn Westcott, a leader of the Golden\\nDawn, who later introduced him to John Yarker.  Yarker chartered Reuss to\\nfound the Rites of Memphis and Mizraim in Germany.  After several\\nattempts to concretize various Masonic Rites, Reuss settled on the\\ndevelopment of the O.T.O.\\n\\n\"The Order experienced reasonably steady growth under Reuss\\' leadership.\\nFor example, he chartered Papus in France, Rudolph Steiner in Berlin\\nand H. Spencer Lewis in the USA.  In 1912, the historic meeting between\\nReuss and Crowley occurred.  Crowley wrote that Reuss came to him and\\naccused him of revealing Order secrets.  When Crowley looked at it afresh,\\nthe initiated interpretation of sexual magick unfolded itself to him for\\nthe first time.  Reuss appointed Crowley as Supreme and Holy King of all\\nthe English speaking world, and it was this authorization that he invoked\\nwhen publishing the material of the Equinox.\\n\\n\"Reuss resigned as Outer Head of the Order in 1922 after suffering a\\nstroke and named Crowley his successor.  All was well until 1925 when\\n_The Book of the Law_ was translated into German.  There was a break\\nin the continuity of the Order.  Manyk members split with the new O.H.O.\\nover the book, which Crowley was actively promulgating through the Order.\\nHe had earlier revise dthe Order rituals at Reuss\\'s request, deeply\\ninfusing the doctrines of the New Aeon revelation.\"\\n\\n_An Introduction to the History of the O.T.O._, by Ad Veritatem IX\\'\\n\\nWithin _Equinox III:10_, Edited by \\n  Hymenaeus Beta, Frater Superior, Rex Summus Sanctissimus,\\n    Caliph of the United States of America,\\n      Published by Samuel Weiser, 1990.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere are many possible reasons that our Frater Superior included this\\nmaterial in _Equinox III:10_.  And this is the real point, is it not?\\nWhy did he wish to publish such things about the history of his own\\norganization?  Does he represent a dogmatic threat to the principle\\nof Thelema?  Or is he exercising his True Will and putting forth very\\ncomplex pictures with no easy answers?  A picture which leaves room\\nfor very many interpretations.\\n\\nIt is quite easy for me to see, for example, that all of O.T.O. derived\\nout of the dribble of faltering Masonry, purchased by clever hucksters\\nwith an ounce of courage and some writing ability to aid them.  And I\\ncan take that all the way down to our present Caliph, whose feeble\\nsupport of the \\'Law of Thelema\\' is laughable at best.\\n\\nWould I be thrown out of the Order for speaking in this way?  \\nWill I?  \\nI think not.\\nWhy?  Because my Frater will see it as a perspective, an interjection\\nI am using as an example.  My illustration shows that we may express things\\nin the context of a larger work and the true significance of this may be\\nquite difficult to apprehend at first.\\n\\nSo it may be with OTO and Merlinus X\\'.  Please look O.T.O. more carefully.\\nI do not support Reuss\\'s words myself, as I am not qualified to assess\\nthem, and I am critical of their pomposity.  If I who am a member of\\nthe Order take such a stand and am allowed to continue doing so, then\\nwhat can this say about the health of the Order?  Does it mean that\\nthe Order has \\'gone soft\\' and abandoned its moral principles?  Or\\ndoes it mean that it is strong in its ability to let the will of\\nuniversal kinship arise on its own, not shackled by some dogmatic\\nrequirement?  How shall we resolve these two possibilities?\\n\\n\\nI find a high calibre of individual associated with Ordo Templi Orientis.\\nThey are often quite intelligent and sometimes very well versed in arcane\\nor usual information.  They are quite often artists and geniuses.  \\nHaving met some 20 longstanding members in the SF Bay Area (many who are or\\nwere very heavily involved with the Order), I can vouch for the integrity\\nof the organization as it stands.\\n\\nI have sometimes questioned the policy of Hymenaeus Beta.  In these moments \\nI followed my intuition, and I\\'ve found little to stop me from requesting\\na Second initiation from a different O.T.O. body.  I\\'m happily participating\\nin social groups (Feasts or Initiations) and have come to know the Gnostic\\nMass well enough for my tastes.\\n \\n\\nThis doesn\\'t make me an authority on Order politics and explanations, however.\\nI can only hypothesize and relay to you what I understand based on my\\nlimited contact with other members.\\n\\nI urge you not to take the words of Merlinus X too far.  There are many\\nways to interpret words, and many people who have become involved with\\nthe Order feel very strongly about the sanctity of personal freedom\\nand the preservation of individual vision.\\n\\nI welcome other comment on this issue and will be writing more in response\\nto other posts in this thread.\\n\\n\\nInvoke me under my stars.

As his guilt has not been established, it is\\nwrong for people to make postings based on this assumption.\\n\\n(b) Islam teaches us _not_ to harm innocents.  If Muslims -- who perhaps\\nhave not realized that Islam teaches this -- perform such actions, it is\\n_not_ _because_ of the teachings of Islam, but rather _in spite of_ and\\n_in contradiction to_ the  teachings of Islam.  This is an important \\ndistinction.\\n\\nI should clarify what Muslims usually mean when they say \"Muslim\".  In\\ngeneral, anyone who calls themselves a \"Muslim\" and does not do or \\noutwardly profess\\nsomething in clear contradiction with the essential teachings of Islam\\nis considered to be a Muslim.  Thus, one who might do things contrary to\\nIslam (through ignorance, for example) does not suddenly _not_ become a\\nMuslim.  If one knowingly transgresses Islamic teachings and essential\\nprinciples, though, then one does leave Islam.\\n\\nThe term \"Muslim\" is to be contrasted with \"Mu\\'min\", which means \"true\\nbeliever\".  However, whether a Muslim is in reality a Mu\\'min is\\nsomething known only by God (and perhaps that person himself).  So you\\nwill not find the term Mu\\'min used very much by Muslims in alt.atheism,\\nbecause it is not known to anybody (except myself and God), whether I,\\nfor example, am a \"true believer\" or not.  For example, I could just be\\nputting on a show here, and in reality believe something opposite to\\nwhat I write here, without anyone knowing.  Thus, when we say \"Muslims\"\\nwe mean all those who outwardly profess to follow Islam, whether in\\npractice they might, in ignorance, transgress Islamic teachings.  By\\n\"Muslim\" we do not necessarily mean \"Mu\\'min\", or \"true believer\" in\\nIslam.\\n\\n Fred Rice\\n darice@yoyo.cc.monash.edu.au   \\n\\n',\n",

The FBI and\\nthe BATF could not let a man like that live.  He was a testimonial to their\\nstupidity and lies.    \\n\\nNow before everyone gets crazy with me, let me say that Koresh was crazy as \\na bed bug, but out government was crazier...and they lied to us.\\n\\nThey told us compound had been under survaillance for quite some time.  Yet, \\nwhoever was watching the place failed to see that Koresh went jogging and into\\ntown on a regular basis.  Everyone in the area claimed to have seen him and \\nwondered why they didn\\'t pick him up then.  There are two possible answers.\\nFirst, they didn\\'t see him.  What kind of survaillance is that?  Second, they\\ndidn\\'t care.  They wanted a confrontation.  They wanted publicity and they got\\nit.\\n\\nAfter the first battle, they told us that they did not know he knew they were\\ncoming.  They also said it would have been foolish to go in knowing that.\\nWell, we know now that they intercepted the informants call and went in anyway.\\n\\nDid they explore all of the possibilities for ending the seige?  According to\\nthem they did, but according to the Hartford Courant, the woman that raised\\nKoresh (His Grandmother) was not allowed to go in and see him.                 \\n The FBI agent who she spoke with was Bob Ricks and according to the paper he\\nsaid:\\n\\n\"A lot of people think if you just talk to them logically they will come out.\\nHis grandmother raised Vernon Howell; (Koresh\\'s Real name)  she didn\\'t raise\\nDavid Koresh.\"\\n\\nSomeone who raises you and loves you does not speak to you strickly on a\\nlogical level.  There is also an emotional level on which they can reach you.\\n\\nHere\\'s another one.  All during this operation the FBI has been claiming that\\nthey feared a mass suicide and that is one of the reasons that something must\\nbe done.  Now they claim they never thought he would do it?\\n\\nI knew they were going to do something when they started talking about how\\nmuch money this was costing.  That was the start of the \"Justification\" part\\npart of the plan.  That\\'s when I knew it would come soon.\\n\\nBut, back to the plan.  It is considered \"Cruel and Unusal Punishment\" to\\nexecute criminals in the minds of many people, but look at what\\'s acceptable.\\n\\nThey knew the parents (adults) had gas masks.  They did not know, or were not\\nsure, if the children had them.  So the plan was to pour the gas into the \\ncompound.  The mothers, seeing what the gas was doing to their children were\\nsupposed to run out and that would only leave the men to deal with.\\n\\nI spent two years in the army and like everyother veteran I went through CBR\\n(Chemical, Biological Radiological) warfare training.  Part of that training\\nis going into a room filled with the same stuff that the children were\\nsubjected to.  To make the stuff really interesting the gas also has a chemical \\nagent that irritates the skin.  You think its on fire.\\n\\nI have no doubts the children would become hysterical.  Its not the kind of\\nthing you never want to do again.  This was the plan, the final solution.\\n\\nWe waited 444 days for our hostages to come home from Iran.  We gave these\\npeople 51 days.  \\n\\nI stated on several occasions that there was absolutely nothing in this whole\\nthing that the government could point to as a success.  Well, FBI agent Ricks\\nchanged my mind.  Again a newclip from the Hartford Courant:\\n\\n\"And while expressing regret at the loss of life, he suggested that the\\noperation had been at least a modified success because not a single federal\\nshot had been fired and not a single federal agent had been hurt.\"\\n\\nIt took 17 dead children to get us that new definition of success.\\n\\nOne more thought.  The government claimed that they believed he had automatic\\nweapons on the premises. \\n                                                      \\n        HE HAD A LICENSE FOR THE 50 CALIBER MACHINE GUN!\\n\\nTHEY KNEW DAMN WELL HE HAD ONE.

I am willing to try to resolve this down to a disagreement on\\ncritical interpretation, but you\\'ll have to support your end, by\\nresponding to my criticism.  I have no doubt as to the ability of a\\nparticular Muslim to go through this book with a highlighter finding\\npassages to take personal offense at, but you have upheld the view\\nthat \"TSV *is* intended as an attack on Islam and upon Muslims\".

I am defending my\\nhonest opinion that this book should not be construed as a calculated\\n(or otherwise) insulting attack on Islam, and the parallel opinion\\nthat most of the criticism of the book I have seen is baseless\\npropaganda.

Isn\\'t she the cutest thing!?\"\\n\\nThis person is not literally claiming to have lined up all the babies in the\\nworld according to cuteness and discovered his own grandchildren tied for\\nfirst.  Rather, he is trying to express his emotions using words that are very\\nobject-oriented.  Because this example is one that is common to many people,\\nnobody misunderstands the intent of the statements; the Bible, however, is\\noften at the mercy of people who assume that everything within must be exactly\\nliterally true.  For those people, the existence of Tyre is a problem; for me,\\nit is not.\\n\\n\\nTurning to the latest person trying to defend Ezekiel, we read this from\\nJohn E King:\\n\\n> The prophesy clearly implies that people would still be living in the\\n> area[.]\\n\\nNo, it implies nothing of the kind.  If you had nothing but the prophecy from\\nEzekiel, and you were told you interpret it literally, you would never say\\n\"Oh, he means that there will be houses and businesses and plants and stuff\\nlike that.\"  You would read \"I will make you a bare rock\" and \"You will never\\nbe rebuilt\", and you\\'d conclude that Tyre would be a bare rock.  The only way\\nto get from `fishing nets\\' to `houses and buildings and a medium-large\\npopulation\\' is if you KNOW that all that latter stuff is there.\\n\\nIn other words, your answer means that Ezekiel misled everybody who read the\\nprophecy at the time it was written.  There is no way that, given a literal\\nreading, they could read this passage and conclude \"medium-size city\".\\n\\nYou seem to feel that \"Never be rebuilt\" means \"be rebuilt\" -- maybe so, but\\nit is hardly a `clear implication\\'.\\n\\n\\nMr King also writes:\\n\\n> So far I\\'ve seen stated figurers ranging from 15,000 to 22,000.\\n> Let\\'s assume the latter one is correct.

You know, the Naval Acadamy, the state capital, George Washington\\nresigned his commission in the statehouse?  Annapolis may not be New York, but\\nit\\'s at least a two-horse town.\\n\\nBut supposing 22,000 people is a \"small town\" -- it\\'s still 22,000 people\\nMORE than Ezekiel predicted.\\n\\n\\nAnd you\\'ve said nothing about the other problem.  In chapter 26, Ezekiel\\npredicts that Nebuchadnezzar will will destroy Tyre and loot all their\\nvaluables.  However, Nebuchadnezzar did NOT destroy Tyre, and in chapter 29\\nEzekiel even quotes God as saying \"he and his army got no reward from the\\ncampaign he led against Tyre.\"\\n\\nLet\\'s ignore Alexander for a moment, and just pay attention to chapter 26.\\nEzekiel says N. would destroy Tyre, and N. did NOT destroy Tyre.  Ezekiel says\\nthat N. would plunder their valuables, but N. did NOT plunder their valuables.\\n\\nRegardless of what you think about Tyre _now_, the fact is that N. died before\\nthe place was destroyed.  Ezekiel said N. was going to do it, and N. did not.\\n\\n *\\n\\nThis post is, of course, pointless.  Inerrantists have an amazing ability\\nto rewrite the Bible as needed to fit whatever they want it to say.\\n\\nFor example, I expect Mr King to respond to the comments about Ezekiel 26\\nby pulling some \"clear implications\" out of hat.\\n\\nWhen Ezekiel said that N. would \"demolish your towers\", that clearly implied\\nthat the walls would still be standing so people would know where the towers\\nused to be.  And when Ezekiel said that N. would \"demolish your fine houses\\nand throw your stones, timber and rubble into the sea\", that clearly implied\\nthat N. would never set foot on the island.  And when Ezekiel wrote that N.\\nwould \"build a ramp up to your walls\", that clearly implies that N. would\\nspend 13 years stomping around on the mainland and never get close to the\\nwalls.\\n\\nSee?

This article attempts to provide a gentle introduction to\\nlogic, in the hope of improving the general level of debate.\\n\\nLogic is the science of reasoning, proof, thinking, or inference [Concise\\nOED].  Logic allows us to analyze a piece of reasoning and determine whether\\nit is correct or not (valid or invalid).  Of course, one does not need to\\nstudy logic in order to reason correctly; nevertheless, a little basic\\nknowledge of logic is often helpful when constructing or analyzing an\\nargument.\\n\\nNote that no claim is being made here about whether logic is universally\\napplicable.  The matter is very much open for debate.  This document merely\\nexplains how to use logic, given that you have already decided that logic is\\nthe right tool for the job.\\n\\nPropositions (or statements) are the building blocks of a logical argument. A\\nproposition is a statement which is either true or false; for example, \"It is\\nraining\" or \"Today is Tuesday\".  Propositions may be either asserted (said to\\nbe true) or denied (said to be false).  Note that this is a technical meaning\\nof \"deny\", not the everyday meaning.\\n\\nThe proposition is the meaning of the statement, not the particular\\narrangement of words used to express it.  So \"God exists\" and \"There exists a\\nGod\" both express the same proposition.\\n\\nAn argument is, to quote the Monty Python sketch, \"a connected series of\\nstatements to establish a definite proposition\".  An argument consists of\\nthree stages.\\n\\nFirst of all, the propositions which are necessary for the argument to\\ncontinue are stated.  These are called the premises of the argument.  They\\nare the evidence or reasons for accepting the argument and its conclusions. \\n\\nPremises (or assertions) are often indicated by phrases such as \"because\",\\n\"since\", \"obviously\" and so on.  (The phrase \"obviously\" is often viewed with\\nsuspicion, as it can be used to intimidate others into accepting suspicious\\npremises.  If something doesn\\'t seem obvious to you, don\\'t be afraid to\\nquestion it.  You can always say \"Oh, yes, you\\'re right, it is obvious\" when\\nyou\\'ve heard the explanation.)\\n\\nNext, the premises are used to derive further propositions by a process known\\nas inference.  In inference, one proposition is arrived at on the basis of\\none or more other propositions already accepted.  There are various forms of\\nvalid inference.\\n\\nThe propositions arrived at by inference may then be used in further\\ninference.  Inference is often denoted by phrases such as \"implies that\" or\\n\"therefore\".\\n\\nFinally, we arrive at the conclusion of the argument -- the proposition which\\nis affirmed on the basis of the premises and inference.  Conclusions are often\\nindicated by phrases such as \"therefore\", \"it follows that\", \"we conclude\"\\nand so on.  The conclusion is often stated as the final stage of inference.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\nEvery event has a cause (premise)\\nThe universe has a beginning (premise)\\nAll beginnings involve an event (premise)\\nThis implies that the beginning of the universe involved an event (inference)\\nTherefore the universe has a cause (inference and conclusion)\\n\\nNote that the conclusion of one argument might be a premise in another\\nargument.  A proposition can only be called a premise or a conclusion with\\nrespect to a particular argument; the terms do not make sense in isolation.\\n\\nSometimes an argument will not follow the order given above; for example,\\nthe conclusions might be stated first and the premises stated \\nafterwards in support of the conclusion.  This is perfectly valid, if \\nsometimes a little confusing.\\n\\nRecognizing an argument is much harder than recognizing premises or\\nconclusions.  Many people shower their writing with assertions without ever\\nproducing anything which one might reasonably describe as an argument.  Some\\nstatements look like arguments, but are not.  For example:\\n\\n\"If the Bible is accurate, Jesus must either have been insane, an evil liar,\\n or the Son of God.\"\\n\\nThis is not an argument, it is a conditional statement.  It does not assert\\nthe premises which are necessary to support what appears to be its \\nconclusion.  (It also suffers from a number of other logical flaws, but we\\'ll\\ncome to those later.)\\n\\nAnother example:\\n\\n\"God created you; therefore do your duty to God.\"\\n\\nThe phrase \"do your duty to God\" is not a proposition, since it is neither\\ntrue nor false.  Therefore it is not a conclusion, and the sentence is not an\\nargument.\\n\\nFinally, causality is important.  Consider a statement of the form \"A because\\nB\".  If we\\'re interested in establishing A and B is offered as evidence, the\\nstatement is an argument.  If we\\'re trying to establish the truth of B, then\\nit is not an argument, it is an explanation.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\n\"There must be something wrong with the engine of my car, because it will not\\n start.\" -- This is an argument.\\n\\n\"My car will not start because there is something wrong with the engine.\"\\n -- This is an explanation.\\n\\nThere are two traditional types of argument, deductive and inductive.  A\\ndeductive argument is one which provides conclusive proof of its conclusions\\n-- that is, an argument where if the premises are true, the conclusion must\\nalso be true.  A deductive argument is either valid or invalid.  A valid\\nargument is defined as one where if the premises are true, then the\\nconclusion is true.\\n\\nAn inductive argument is one where the premises provide some evidence for the\\ntruth of the conclusion.  Inductive arguments are not valid or invalid;\\nhowever, we can talk about whether they are better or worse than other\\narguments, and about how probable their premises are.\\n\\nThere are forms of argument in ordinary language which are neither deductive\\nnor inductive.  However, we will concentrate for the moment on deductive\\narguments, as they are often viewed as the most rigorous and convincing.\\n\\nIt is important to note that the fact that a deductive argument is valid does\\nnot imply that its conclusion holds.  This is because of the slightly \\ncounter-intuitive nature of implication, which we must now consider more\\ncarefully.\\n\\nObviously a valid argument can consist of true propositions.  However, an\\nargument may be entirely valid even if it contains only false propositions. \\nFor example:\\n\\n   All insects have wings (premise)\\n   Woodlice are insects (premise)\\n   Therefore woodlice have wings (conclusion)\\n\\nHere, the conclusion is not true because the argument\\'s premises are false. \\nIf the argument\\'s premises were true, however, the conclusion would be true. \\nThe argument is thus entirely valid.\\n\\nMore subtly, we can reach a true conclusion from one or more false premises,\\nas in:\\n\\n   All fish live in the sea (premise)\\n   Dolphins are fish (premise)\\n   Therefore dolphins live in the sea (conclusion)\\n\\nHowever, the one thing we cannot do is reach a false conclusion through valid\\ninference from true premises.  We can therefore draw up a \"truth table\" for\\nimplication.\\n\\nThe symbol \"=>\" denotes implication; \"A\" is the premise, \"B\" the conclusion. \\n\"T\" and \"F\" represent true and false respectively.\\n\\nPremise Conclusion Inference\\n   A        B        A=>B\\n----------------------------\\n   F        F         T      If the premises are false and the inference\\n   F        T         T      valid, the conclusion can be true or false.\\n\\n   T        F         F      If the premises are true and the conclusion\\n                             false, the inference must be invalid.\\n\\n   T        T         T      If the premises are true and the inference valid,\\n                             the conclusion must be true.\\n\\nA sound argument is a valid argument whose premises are true.  A sound \\nargument therefore arrives at a true conclusion.  Be careful not to confuse\\nvalid arguments with sound arguments.\\n\\nTo delve further into the structure of logical arguments would require\\nlengthy discussion of linguistics and philosophy.  It is simpler and probably\\nmore useful to summarize the major pitfalls to be avoided when constructing\\nan argument.  These pitfalls are known as fallacies.\\n\\nIn everyday English the term \"fallacy\" is used to refer to mistaken beliefs\\nas well as to the faulty reasoning that leads to those beliefs.  This is fair\\nenough, but in logic the term is generally used to refer to a form of\\ntechnically incorrect argument, especially if the argument appears valid or\\nconvincing.\\n\\nSo for the purposes of this discussion, we define a fallacy as a logical\\nargument which appears to be correct, but which can be seen to be incorrect\\nwhen examined more closely.  By studying fallacies we aim to avoid being\\nmisled by them.  The following list of fallacies is not intended to be\\nexhaustive.\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD BACULUM (APPEAL TO FORCE)\\n\\nThe Appeal to Force is committed when the arguer resorts to force or the\\nthreat of force in order to try and push the acceptance of a conclusion.  It\\nis often used by politicians, and can be summarized as \"might makes right\". \\nThe force threatened need not be a direct threat from the arguer.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\"... Thus there is ample proof of the truth of the Bible.  All those who\\nrefuse to accept that truth will burn in Hell.\"\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD HOMINEM\\n\\nArgumentum ad hominem is literally \"argument directed at the man\".\\n\\nThe Abusive variety of Argumentum ad Hominem occurs when, instead of trying\\nto disprove the truth of an assertion, the arguer attacks the person or\\npeople making the assertion.  This is invalid because the truth of an\\nassertion does not depend upon the goodness of those asserting it.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\"Atheism is an evil philosophy.  It is practised by Communists and murderers.\"\\n\\nSometimes in a court of law doubt is cast upon the testimony of a witness by \\nshowing, for example, that he is a known perjurer.  This is a valid way of\\nreducing the credibility of the testimony given by the witness, and not\\nargumentum ad hominem; however, it does not demonstrate that the witness\\'s\\ntestimony is false.  To conclude otherwise is to fall victim of the\\nArgumentum ad Ignorantiam (see elsewhere in this list).\\n\\nThe circumstantial form of Argumentum ad Hominem is committed when a person\\nargues that his opponent ought to accept the truth of an assertion because of\\nthe opponent\\'s particular circumstances.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\"It is perfectly acceptable to kill animals for food.  How can you argue\\notherwise when you\\'re quite happy to wear leather shoes?\"\\n\\nThis is an abusive charge of inconsistency, used as an excuse for dismissing\\nthe opponent\\'s argument.\\n\\nThis fallacy can also be used as a means of rejecting a conclusion.  For \\nexample:\\n\\n\"Of course you would argue that positive discrimination is a bad thing. \\nYou\\'re white.\"\\n\\nThis particular form of Argumentum ad Hominem, when one alleges that one\\'s\\nadversary is rationalizing a conclusion formed from selfish interests, is\\nalso known as \"poisoning the well\".\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD IGNORANTIUM\\n\\nArgumentum ad ignorantium means \"argument from ignorance\".  This fallacy\\noccurs whenever it is argued that something must be true simply because it\\nhas not been proved false.  Or, equivalently, when it is argued that\\nsomething must be false because it has not been proved true.  (Note that this\\nis not the same as assuming that something is false until it has been proved\\ntrue, a basic scientific principle.)\\n\\nExamples:\\n\"Of course the Bible is true.  Nobody can prove otherwise.\"\\n\\n\"Of course telepathy and other psychic phenomena do not exist.  Nobody has\\nshown any proof that they are real.\"\\n\\nNote that this fallacy does not apply in a court of law, where one is\\ngenerally assumed innocent until proven guilty.\\n\\nAlso, in scientific investigation if it is known that an event would produce\\ncertain evidence of its having occurred, the absence of such evidence can \\nvalidly be used to infer that the event did not occur.  For example:\\n\\n\"A flood as described in the Bible would require an enormous volume of water\\nto be present on the earth.  The earth does not have a tenth as much water,\\neven if we count that which is frozen into ice at the poles.  Therefore no\\nsuch flood occurred.\"\\n\\nIn science, we can validly assume from lack of evidence that something has\\nnot occurred.  We cannot conclude with certainty that it has not occurred,\\nhowever.\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD MISERICORDIAM\\n\\nThis is the Appeal to Pity, also known as Special Pleading.  The fallacy is \\ncommitted when the arguer appeals to pity for the sake of getting a \\nconclusion accepted.  For example:\\n\\n\"I did not murder my mother and father with an axe.  Please don\\'t find me\\nguilty; I\\'m suffering enough through being an orphan.\"\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD POPULUM\\n\\nThis is known as Appealing to the Gallery, or Appealing to the People.  To\\ncommit this fallacy is to attempt to win acceptance of an assertion by\\nappealing to a large group of people.  This form of fallacy is often\\ncharacterized by emotive language.  For example:\\n\\n\"Pornography must be banned.  It is violence against women.\"\\n\\n\"The Bible must be true.  Millions of people know that it is.  Are you trying\\nto tell them that they are all mistaken fools?\"\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD NUMERAM\\n\\nThis fallacy is closely related to the argumentum ad populum.  It consists of\\nasserting that the more people who support or believe a proposition, the more\\nlikely it is that that proposition is correct.\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD VERECUNDIAM\\n\\nThe Appeal to Authority uses the admiration of the famous to try and win\\nsupport for an assertion.  For example:\\n\\n\"Isaac Newton was a genius and he believed in God.\"\\n\\nThis line of argument is not always completely bogus; for example, reference\\nto an admitted authority in a particular field may be relevant to a\\ndiscussion of that subject.  For example, we can distinguish quite clearly\\nbetween:\\n\\n\"Stephen Hawking has concluded that black holes give off radiation\"\\nand\\n\"John Searle has concluded that it is impossible to build an intelligent\\n computer\"\\n\\nHawking is a physicist, and so we can reasonably expect his opinions on black\\nhole radiation to be informed.  Searle is a linguist, so it is questionable \\nwhether he is well-qualified to speak on the subject of machine intelligence.\\n\\nTHE FALLACY OF ACCIDENT\\n\\nThe Fallacy of Accident is committed when a general rule is applied to a\\nparticular case whose \"accidental\" circumstances mean that the rule is\\ninapplicable.  It is the error made when one goes from the general to the\\nspecific.  For example:\\n\\n\"Christians generally dislike atheists.  You are a Christian, so you must\\ndislike atheists.\"\\n\\nThis fallacy is often committed by moralists and legalists who try to decide\\nevery moral and legal question by mechanically applying general rules.\\n\\nCONVERSE ACCIDENT / HASTY GENERALIZATION\\n\\nThis fallacy is the reverse of the fallacy of accident.  It occurs when one\\nforms a general rule by examining only a few specific cases which are not\\nrepresentative of all possible cases.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\"Jim Bakker was an insincere Christian.  Therefore all Christians are\\ninsincere.\"\\n\\nSWEEPING GENERALIZATION / DICTO SIMPLICITER\\n\\nA sweeping generalization occurs when a general rule is applied to a\\nparticular situation in which the features of that particular situation\\nrender the rule inapplicable.  A sweeping generalization is the opposite of a\\nhasty generalization.\\n\\nNON CAUSA PRO CAUSA / POST HOC ERGO PROPTER HOC\\n\\nThese are known as False Cause fallacies.\\n\\nThe fallacy of Non Causa Pro Causa occurs when one identifies something as the\\ncause of an event but it has not actually been shown to be the cause.  For \\nexample:\\n\\n\"I took an aspirin and prayed to God, and my headache disappeared.  So God\\ncured me of the headache.\"\\n\\nThe fallacy of Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc occurs when something is assumed to\\nbe the cause of an event merely because it happened before the event.  For \\nexample:\\n\\n\"The Soviet Union collapsed after taking up atheism.  Therefore we must avoid\\natheism for the same reasons.\"\\n\\nCUM HOC ERGO PROPTER HOC\\n\\nThis fallacy is similar to post hoc ergo propter hoc.  It asserts that\\nbecause two events occur together, they must be causally related, and leaves\\nno room for other factors that may be the cause(s) of the events.\\n\\nPETITIO PRINCIPII\\n\\nThis fallacy occurs when the premises are at least as questionable as the\\nconclusion reached.\\n\\nCIRCULUS IN DEMONSTRANDO\\n\\nThis fallacy occurs when one assumes as a premise the conclusion which one\\nwishes to reach.  Often, the proposition will be rephrased so that the\\nfallacy appears to be a valid argument.  For example:\\n\\n\"Homosexuals must not be allowed to hold government office.  Hence any\\ngovernment official who is revealed to be a homosexual will lose his job. \\nTherefore homosexuals will do anything to hide their secret, and will be open\\nto blackmail.  Therefore homosexuals cannot be allowed to hold government\\noffice.\"\\n\\nNote that the argument is entirely circular; the premise is the same as the \\nconclusion.  An argument like the above has actually been cited as the reason\\nfor the British Secret Services\\' official ban on homosexual employees. \\nAnother example is the classic:\\n\\n\"We know that God exists because the Bible tells us so.  And we know that the\\nBible is true because it is the word of God.\"\\n\\nCOMPLEX QUESTION / FALLACY OF INTERROGATION\\n\\nThis is the Fallacy of Presupposition.  One example is the classic loaded \\nquestion:\\n\\n\"Have you stopped beating your wife?\"\\n\\nThe question presupposes a definite answer to another question which has not\\neven been asked.  This trick is often used by lawyers in cross-examination,\\nwhen they ask questions like:\\n\\n\"Where did you hide the money you stole?\"\\n\\nSimilarly, politicians often ask loaded questions such as:\\n\\n\"How long will this EC interference in our affairs be allowed to continue?\"\\nor\\n\"Does the Chancellor plan two more years of ruinous privatization?\"\\n\\nIGNORATIO ELENCHI\\n\\nThe fallacy of Irrelevant Conclusion consists of claiming that an argument \\nsupports a particular conclusion when it is actually logically nothing to do\\nwith that conclusion.\\n\\nFor example, a Christian may begin by saying that he will argue that the\\nteachings of Christianity are undoubtably true.  If he then argues at length\\nthat Christianity is of great help to many people, no matter how well he\\nargues he will not have shown that Christian teachings are true.\\n\\nSadly, such fallacious arguments are often successful because they arouse\\nemotions which cause others to view the supposed conclusion in a more\\nfavourable light.\\n\\nEQUIVOCATION\\n\\nEquivocation occurs when a key word is used with two or more different\\nmeanings in the same argument.  For example:\\n\\n\"What could be more affordable than free software?  But to make sure that it\\nremains free, that users can do what they like with it, we must place a\\nlicense on it to make sure that will always be freely redistributable.\"\\n\\nAMPHIBOLY\\n\\nAmphiboly occurs when the premises used in an argument are ambiguous because\\nof careless or ungrammatical phrasing.\\n\\nACCENT\\n\\nAccent is another form of fallacy through shifting meaning.  In this case,\\nthe meaning is changed by altering which parts of a statement are\\nemphasized.  For example, consider:\\n\\n\"We should not speak ILL of our friends\"\\nand\\n\"We should not speak ill of our FRIENDS\"\\n\\nFALLACIES OF COMPOSITION\\n\\nOne fallacy of composition is to conclude that a property shared by the parts\\nof something must apply to the whole.  For example:\\n\\n\"The bicycle is made entirely of low mass components, and is therefore very \\nlightweight.\"\\n\\nThe other fallacy of composition is to conclude that a property of a number\\nof individual items is shared by a collection of those items.  For example:\\n\\n\"A car uses less petrol and causes less pollution than a bus.  Therefore cars\\nare less environmentally damaging than buses.\"\\n\\nFALLACY OF DIVISION\\n\\nThe fallacy of division is the opposite of the fallacy of composition.  Like\\nits opposite, it exists in two varieties.  The first is to assume that a\\nproperty of some thing must apply to its parts.  For example:\\n\\n\"You are studying at a rich college.  Therefore you must be rich.\"\\n\\nThe other is to assume that a property of a collection of items is shared by\\neach item.  For example:\\n\\n\"Ants can destroy a tree.  Therefore this ant can destroy a tree.\"\\n\\nTHE SLIPPERY SLOPE ARGUMENT\\n\\nThis argument states that should one event occur, so will other harmful\\nevents.  There is no proof made that the harmful events are caused by the\\nfirst event.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\"If we legalize marijuana, then we would have to legalize crack and heroin\\nand we\\'ll have a nation full of drug-addicts on welfare.  Therefore we cannot\\nlegalize marijuana.\"\\n\\n\"A IS BASED ON B\" FALLACIES / \"IS A TYPE OF\" FALLACIES\\n\\nThese fallacies occur when one attempts to argue that things are in some way\\nsimilar without actually specifying in what way they are similar.\\n\\nExamples:\\n\"Isn\\'t history based upon faith?  If so, then isn\\'t the Bible also a form of\\nhistory?\"\\n\\n\"Islam is based on faith, Christianity is based on faith, so isn\\'t Islam a\\nform of Christianity?\"\\n\\n\"Cats are a form of animal based on carbon chemistry, dogs are a form of\\nanimal based on carbon chemistry, so aren\\'t dogs a form of cat?\"\\n\\nAFFIRMATION OF THE CONSEQUENT\\n\\nThis fallacy is an argument of the form \"A implies B, B is true, therefore A\\nis true\".  To understand why it is a fallacy, examine the truth table for\\nimplication given earlier.\\n\\nDENIAL OF THE ANTECEDENT\\n\\nThis fallacy is an argument of the form \"A implies B, A is false, therefore B\\nis false\".  Again, the truth table for implication makes it clear why this is\\na fallacy.\\n\\nNote that this fallacy is different from Non Causa Pro Causa; the latter has\\nthe form \"A implies B, A is false, therefore B is false\", where A does NOT in\\nfact imply B at all.  Here, the problem is not that the implication is\\ninvalid; rather it is that the falseness of A does not allow us to deduce\\nanything about B.\\n\\nCONVERTING A CONDITIONAL\\n\\nThis fallacy is an argument of the form \"If A then B, therefore if B then A\".\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD ANTIQUITAM\\n\\nThis is the fallacy of asserting that something is right or good simply\\nbecause it is old, or because \"that\\'s the way it\\'s always been.\"\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD NOVITAM\\n\\nThis is the opposite of the argumentum ad antiquitam; it is the fallacy of\\nasserting that something is more correct simply because it is new or newer\\nthan something else.\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD CRUMENAM\\n\\nThe fallacy of believing that money is a criterion of correctness; that those\\nwith more money are more likely to be right.\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD LAZARUM\\n\\nThe fallacy of assuming that because someone is poor he or she is sounder or\\nmore virtuous than one who is wealthier.  This fallacy is the opposite of the\\nargumentum ad crumenam.\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD NAUSEAM\\n\\nThis is the incorrect belief that an assertion is more likely to be true the\\nmore often it is heard.  An \"argumentum ad nauseum\" is one that employs\\nconstant repetition in asserting something.\\n\\nBIFURCATION\\n\\nAlso referred to as the \"black and white\" fallacy, bifurcation occurs when\\none presents a situation as having only two alternatives, where in fact other\\nalternatives exist or can exist.\\n\\nPLURIUM INTERROGATIONUM / MANY QUESTIONS\\n\\nThis fallacy occurs when a questioner demands a simple answer to a complex\\nquestion.\\n\\nNON SEQUITUR\\n\\nA non-sequitur is an argument where the conclusion is drawn from premises\\nwhich are not logically connected with it.\\n\\nRED HERRING\\n\\nThis fallacy is committed when irrelevant material is introduced to the issue\\nbeing discussed, so that everyone\\'s attention is diverted away from the\\npoints being made, towards a different conclusion.\\n\\nREIFICATION / HYPOSTATIZATION\\n\\nReification occurs when an abstract concept is treated as a concrete thing.\\n\\nSHIFTING THE BURDEN OF PROOF\\n\\nThe burden of proof is always on the person making an assertion or\\nproposition.  Shifting the burden of proof, a special case of argumentum ad\\nignorantium, is the fallacy of putting the burden of proof on the person who\\ndenies or questions the assertion being made.  The source of the fallacy is\\nthe assumption that something is true unless proven otherwise.\\n\\nSTRAW MAN\\n\\nThe straw man fallacy is to misrepresent someone else\\'s position so that it\\ncan be attacked more easily, then to knock down that misrepresented position,\\nthen to conclude that the original position has been demolished.  It is a\\nfallacy because it fails to deal with the actual arguments that have been\\nmade.\\n\\nTHE EXTENDED ANALOGY\\n\\nThe fallacy of the Extended Analogy often occurs when some suggested general\\nrule is being argued over.  The fallacy is to assume that mentioning two \\ndifferent situations, in an argument about a general rule, constitutes a \\nclaim that those situations are analogous to each other.\\n\\nThis fallacy is best explained using a real example from a debate about \\nanti-cryptography legislation:\\n\\n\"I believe it is always wrong to oppose the law by breaking it.\"\\n\\n\"Such a position is odious: it implies that you would not have supported\\n Martin Luther King.\"\\n\\n\"Are you saying that cryptography legislation is as important as the\\n struggle for Black liberation?  How dare you!\"\\n\\nTU QUOQUE\\n\\nThis is the famous \"you too\" fallacy.  It occurs when an action is argued to\\nbe acceptable because the other party has performed it.  For instance:\\n\\n\"You\\'re just being randomly abusive.\"\\n\"So?  You\\'ve been abusive too.\"\\n\\nÿ\\n',\n",

Literally. There is\\n     nothing symbolic about it. This however, contradicts what the Bible\\n     says. The Bible teaches that not everyone is a child of God:\\n\\n          The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the \\n          kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked [one];\\n          (Matthew 13:38)\\n\\n          I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and ye do that which \\n          ye have seen with your father. (John 8:38)\\n\\n          Ye do the deeds of your father. Then said they to him, We be not \\n          born of fornication; we have one Father, [even] God.  Jesus said \\n          unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I \\n          proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he \\n          sent me.  Why do ye not understand my speech? [even] because ye \\n          cannot hear my word.  Ye are of [your] father the devil, and the \\n          lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the \\n          beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in \\n          him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a \\n          liar, and the father of it. (John 8:41-44)\\n\\n          And said, O full of all subtilty and all mischief, [thou] child of \\n          the devil, [thou] enemy of all righteousness, wilt thou not cease \\n          to pervert the right ways of the Lord? (Acts 13:10)\\n\\n          Wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this \\n          world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit \\n          that now worketh in the children of disobedience: (Ephesians 2:2)\\n\\n          In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the \\n          devil: whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God, neither he \\n          that loveth not his brother. (1 John 3:10)\\n\\n     One becomes a child of God...\\n\\n          But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the\\n          sons of God, [even] to them that believe on his name: (John 1:12)\\n\\n          Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that\\n          we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world knoweth us\\n          not, because it knew him not.  Beloved, now are we the sons of God,\\n          and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when\\n          he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he\\n          is. (1 John 3:1-2)\\n\\n     ...when he is born again through faith in Jesus Christ:\\n\\n          Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of\\n          the will of man, but of God. (John 1:13)\\n\\n          Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus\\n          Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will,\\n          (Ephesians 1:5)\\n\\n          Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should\\n          be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures. (James 1:18)\\n\\n          For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of\\n          God. For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear;\\n          but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba,\\n          Father. The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we\\n          are the children of God: (Romans 8:14-16)\\n\\n          Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one\\n          that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God. (1 John 4:7)\\n\\n          Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God: and\\n          every one that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is\\n          begotten of him.

The fact that some groups try to read \\n     something into the Bible, doesn\\'t change what the Bible teaches. For \\n     example, the fact that the Jehovah\\'s Witnesses deny the Deity of Christ \\n     does not alter what the Bible teaches [ \"Looking for that blessed hope,\\n     and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus\\n     Christ;\" (Titus 2:13),\"Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus\\n     Christ, to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through\\n     the righteousness of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ:\" (2 Peter 1:1)] \\n     on the Deity of Christ.\\n\\n     We first look to the Bible to see what it teaches. To discount, or not \\n     even address, what the Bible teaches because there are some groups that \\n     have differing views is self-defeating. To see what the Bible teaches, \\n     you have to look at the Bible.\\n\\nra> >     \"Our Lord\\'s mortality was essential to his own salvation\" (_The\\nra> >     Promised Messiah_, p. 456), \"He had to work out his own salvation by\\nra> >     doing the will of the Father in all things\" (ibid., p.54), \"he had\\nra> >     to be baptized to gain admission to the celestial kingdom\" (_Mormon\\nra> >     Doctrine_, p.71).\\nra>\\nra>    Welcome to the wonderful world of Mormon paradoctrine, Robert.

Note that I do not necessarily\\nagree or disagree with any of what follows: I present it as information.\\n\\n *\\n\\nFor a short summary:  a Southern Baptist named Larry Holly wrote a book\\nclaiming that Freemasonry is a religion incompatible with Christianity.\\n(Mr Holly\\'s father rejects Christianity, and Mr Holly blames that on the\\nMasons.)\\n\\nThe SBC\\'s Home Missions Board includes an interfaith witness department,\\nwhich studies other religions and how to teach them about Christ.  A few\\nyears ago, they were ordered to produce a report on Masonry: they concluded\\nthat it was not a religion, and therefore was outside their speciality.\\nHowever, Mr Holly led a movement of people who oppose Masonry, and\\nlast year the Convention again ordered the HMB to study Masonry.  (I got the\\nfeeling that they were saying \"You got the wrong answer last time, try to\\ndo better and get the answer we want.\")\\n\\nAnyway, there\\'s been a bit of infighting and some inappropriate actions, but\\nthe dust has settled and the report is in.  Nobody is entirely happy with it,\\nbut everybody seems willing to live with it.  Both sides are saying things\\nsuch as: \"This was the best we were going to get in the current environment.\"\\n\\nThe report commends the Masons for the charity work they do, such as the\\nhospitals and burn centers they operate, as well as efforts to help the\\nelderly and prevent drug abuse.  The report acknowledges that many well-\\nknown Christians are and have been Masons, and notes that many teachings\\nof Masonry are \"supportive of Christian faith and practice\".  Examples of\\nthe latter include belief in God, emphases on honesty and integrity, and\\nthat some Masonic lodges incorporate explicit Christian beliefs.\\n\\nOn the other hand, they note that some aspects of Masonry are incompatible\\nwith Southern Baptist principles.  These included the use of titles which some\\npeople consider sacrilegious, the taking of certain oaths (even though they\\nare not meant seriously), the \"undeniably pagan and/or occultic\" writings of\\nsome Masonic leaders, the implication in some Masonic writings that salvation\\ncan be achieved by good works, and the racial discrimination practiced by many\\nMasonic lodges.  (I note with some chagrin that Baptist churches as a whole\\naren\\'t really in a place to speak on this last point.)\\n\\n\\nThe report concludes that Masonry is not a religion, and says that membership\\nshould not be endorsed or censured, but left to the discretion of individuals.\\nThis was in part because there is variation among different Masonic Lodges,\\nand while one may include elements strongly against Christianity, another may\\nnot.  Many Southern Baptists have strong convictions about the priesthood of\\nthe believer and the autonomy of the local church, and this history probably\\ninfluenced how the report came out.\\n\\n *\\n\\nThe information above was gleaned from \"The Religious Herald\", a publication\\nof the Baptist General Association of Virginia, and \"Baptists Today\", which\\ndoes not have any direct links to a religious organisation.  (Autonomy is a\\nbig issue among some Baptists.  8-)\\n\\nBecause I have neither the report itself, nor whatever Masonic documents are\\nrelevant to these issues, none of the above comes with a guarantee.

The Book of Esther (which I read the other day for\\nother reasons) describes the origin of Pur'im, a Jewish celbration of joy\\nand peace.  The long and short of the story is that 75,000 people were\\nkilled when people were tripping over all of the peacefull solutions \\nlying about (you couldn't swing a sacred cow without slammin into a nice,\\npeaceful solution.)  'Course Joshua and the jawbone of an ass spring to\\nmind...\\n\\nI agree with Bobby this far: religion as it is used to kill large numbers\\nof people is usually not used in the form or manner that it was originally\\nintended for.\\n\\nThat doesn't reduce the number of deaths directly caused by religion, it is\\njust a minor observation of the fact that there is almost nothing pure in\\nthe Universe.  The very act of honestly attempting to find true meaning in\\nreligious teaching has many times inspired hatred and led to war.  Many\\npeople have been led by religious leaders more involved in their own\\nstomache-contentsthan in any absolute truth, and have therefore been driven to\\nkill by their leaders.\\n\\nThe point is that there are many things involved in religion that often\\nlead to war.  Whether these things are a part of religion, an unpleasant\\nside effect or (as Bobby would have it) the result of people switching\\nbetween Religion and Atheism spontaneously, the results are the same.  \\n\\n@Religious groups have long been involved in the majority of the bloodiest\\nparts of Man's history.@\\n\\nAtheists, on the other hand (preen,preen) are typically not an ideological\\nsocial caste, nor are they driven to organize and spread their beliefs.\\nThe overuse of Nazism and Stalinism just show how true this is:  Two groups\\nwith very clear and specific ideologies using religious persecution to\\nfurther their means.  Anyone who cannot see the obvious - namely that these\\nwere groups founded for reasons *entirely* their own, who used religious\\npersecution not because of any belief system but because it made them more\\npowerfull - is trying too hard.  Basically, Bobby uses these examples\\nbecause there are so few wars that were *not* *specifically* fought over\\nreligion that he does not have many choices.\\n\\nWell, I'm off to Key West where the only flames are heating the bottom of\\nlittle silver butter-dishes.\\n\\n-ciao\\n\\n-chris blask\\n\",\n",

I\\'ll continue to re-post periodically until\\n*** he answers them, publicly indicates that he won\\'t answer them,\\n*** stops posting to alt.atheism, the alt.atheism community tells\\n*** me to stop, or I get totally bored.  I apologize for the \\n*** somewhat juvenile nature of this approach, but I\\'m at a loss\\n*** to figure out another way to crack his intransigence and \\n*** seeming intellectual dishonesty.\\n***\\n*** This is re-post #3.\\n\\n\\nCharley,\\n\\nI can\\'t help but notice that you have still failed to provide answers\\nto substantive questions that have been raised in response to your\\nprevious posts.  I submit that you don\\'t answer them because you\\ncannot answer them without running afoul of your own logic, and I once\\nagain challenge you to prove me wrong.  To make the task as easy for\\nyou as possible, I\\'ll present concise re-statements of some of the\\nquestions that you have failed to answer, in the hope that you may\\naddress them one at a time for all to see.\\n\\nShould you fail to answer again within a reasonable time period, I\\nwill re-post this article, with suitable additions and deletions, at\\nsuch time that I notice a post by you on another topic.  I will repeat\\nthis procedure until you either address the outstanding challenges or\\nyou cease to post to this newsgroup.\\n\\nI would like to apologize in advance if you have answered any of these\\nquestions previously and your answer missed my notice.  If you can be\\nkind enough to re-post or e-mail such articles, I will be only too\\npleased to publicly rescind the challenge in question, and remove it\\nfrom this list.\\n\\nNow, to the questions...\\n\\n1. After claiming that all atheists fit into neat psychological\\npatterns that you proposed, then semi-retracting that claim by stating\\nthat you weren\\'t referring to *all* atheists, I asked you to name some\\natheists who you feel don\\'t fit your patterns, to show that you indeed\\nwere not referring to all atheists that you are aware of.  You failed\\nto do so.  Please do so now.\\n\\nQuestion: Can you name any a.a posters who do not fit into your\\nstereotype?\\n\\nHere is the context for the question:\\n\\n>>> This is not true for everyone on this board, and you are out of line\\n>>> in assuming that it is.\\n>>\\n>>YOU, however, deleted the text further along where I said that I didn\\'t mean\\n>>to imply that everybody\\'s experience was along the same lines.  \\n>\\n>Whether or not you *mean* to make such implications, you do so\\n>repeatedly.  \\n>\\n>Allow me to approach the issue from another viewpoint: can you name\\n>those atheists that you\\'ve come across who *do not* fit into the\\n>patterns that you theorize?\\n\\n\\n2. You have taken umbrage to statements to the effect that \"senses and\\nreason are all we have to go by\", and when pressed, you have implied\\nthat we have an alternative called revelation.  I have repeatedly\\nasked you to explain what revelation is and how one can both\\nexperience and interpret revelation without doing so via our senses\\nand reason.  You failed to do so.  Please do so now.\\n\\nQuestion: Can you explain what is revelation and how one can\\nexperience and interpret it without using senses and inherent\\nreasoning?\\n\\nHere is the context for the question:\\n\\n>>Revelation is not reason, and if we DO have revelation, then\\n>>reasoning is NOT all we have.\\n\\n>First, show me that revelation exists.  Second, if revelation is not\\n>perceived through the senses, how exactly is it perceived?  According\\n>to my Webster\\'s, revelation is \"an act of revealing or communicating\\n>divine truth.\"  Now, tell me how such a thing can be revealed/\\n>communicated other than via the senses?  Tell me how you can interpret\\n>this revelation other than with reason, that is, using your brain to\\n>interpret what you are sensing.  When I say there is no way for a\\n>human being to interface with the universe other than via the senses as\\n>interpreted by reason (your brain), it is because this is the simple\\n>truth.  If you have another mechanism of interface, by all means,\\n>share it with us.\\n\\nthen later...\\n\\n>>>You CANNOT escape the fact that our entire interface with the universe is\\n>>>our senses and our reason, period.\\n>>\\n>>Again, this is indefensible.  \\n>\\n>No, it is simple truth.  I challenge you to show me otherwise.\\n\\nthen later...\\n\\n>>Few mystics will agree to this assertion, and the common defense of\\n>>redefining \"senses\" to absorb (for instance) mystical experiences is\\n>>begs the question of whether some senses are better than others.\\n>\\n>I allow you the broadest definition of senses, to make things easier\\n>for you.  Now, show me that \"mystical experiences\" exist.  Remember,\\n>you aren\\'t allowed to go by testimony of others (e.g., mystics), since\\n>you have dismissed my testimony as unreliable - you know, tainted by\\n>my own bias.  Further, once these mystical thingies are absorbed, show\\n>me evidence that a human can recognize and respond to them short of\\n>interpretation via that person\\'s reasoning capabilities.\\n>\\n>I challenge you to show me these things.  If you cannot do so, you\\n>might as well give up the fight.\\n\\nthen later...\\n\\n>Let me reiterate, you have NOT explained your interpretation of your\\n>experiences, so it is not possible for me to have attacked them.  In\\n>point of fact, I specifically challenged you to explain this\\n>revelation stuff that you were talking about, and I note for the\\n>record that you appear to have declined my challenge.\\n>\\n>*What* is it?  *How* is it sensed?  *How* is it interpreted?  And\\n>*how* does this sensing and interpretation occur without the conduit\\n>of our senses and reasoning abilities?  You have answered none of\\n>these questions that go straight to the heart of your claims.  If you\\n>can\\'t answer them, your claims are entirely specious.\\n\\n\\n3.  You have stated that all claims to dispassionate analysis made by\\na.a posters are unverifiable and fantastical.  I asked you to identify\\none such claim that I have made.  You have failed to do so.  Please do\\nso now.\\n\\nQuestion: Have I made any claims at all that are unverifiable and\\nfantastical?  If so, please repeat them.\\n\\nHere is the context for the question:\\n\\n\\n>>I must thank David Wood a most sensitive and intelligent (if wrong :-))\\n>>posting.  \\n\\nthen later...\\n\\n>>Likewise, the reference to \"unverifiable, fantastical\\n>>claims\" represents fairly accurately my reaction to all of the claims to\\n>>dispassionate analysis that are repeated in this group.\\n>\\n>Give me your address and I\\'ll be pleased to send you a dictionary.\\n>Failing that, can you name ONE claim that I have made that is in any\\n>sense unverifiable or fantastical?  I demand that you retract this\\n>statement if you cannot offer up evidence.  If you follow your usual\\n>pattern of ignoring the challenge, then you are simply an asshole.\\n\\n\\n4.  First you dismissed claims by atheists that they became atheists as\\na result of reason, then later you stated that if one accepted the\\n\"axioms\" of reason that one couldn\\'t help but become atheist.  I asked\\nyou to explain the contradiction.  Your only response was a statement\\nthat the question was incoherent, an opinion not shared by others that\\nI have asked, be they atheist or theist.  You have failed to answer\\nthe question.  Please do so now.\\n\\nQuestion: Do you retract your claim that a.a posters have not become\\natheists as a result of reason, despite their testimony to that\\neffect?  If you don\\'t retract that claim, do you retract the\\nsubsequent claim that acceptance of the axioms of reason inevitably\\nresult in atheism?\\n\\nHere is the context for the question:\\n\\n[First quote]\\n>>...we have here a bunch of people who claim that their position is\\n>>based on reason... it is up to atheists to prove it to me...\\n>\\n>then,\\n>\\n[Second quote]\\n>>...but I do not see how one can accept these axioms and not end up with\\n>>an atheistic point of view.\\n\\n\\n5.  First, you claimed that you would (probably) not answer these\\nChallenges because they contained too much in the way of \"included\\ntext\" from previous posts.  Later, you implied that you wouldn\\'t\\nrespond because I was putting words in your mouth.  Please clarify\\nthis seeming contradiction.\\n\\nQuestion:  Do you prefer to respond to Challenges that include context\\nfrom your own posts, or that I paraphrase your positions in order to\\navoid \"included text\"?\\n\\nHere is the context for the question:\\n\\nFirst you said:\\n\\n>>My ordinary rules are that I don\\'t read articles over over 150 lines\\n>>or articles in which there is nothing but included text on the first\\n>>screen.

As I mentioned in the Tradition\\n# cited above, for example, it was sufficient in the absence of a theory\\n# about germs and disease spread by worms to simply describe the \"evil\"\\n# which was passed to a consumer of spoiled food as \"satanic.\"\\n\\n     Which begs the question: if Satan in this case is\\n     metaphorical, how can you be certain Allah is not\\n     the same way?\\n\\n# The bottom line here, however, is that describing a spiritual plane\\n# in human language is something like describing \"color\" to a person\\n# who has been blind from birth.

The first\\n# is intended as a light hearted description of a mathematical con-\\n# cept...\\n\\n[some deleted for space saving]\\n\\n# When language fails because it cannot be used to adequately describe\\n# another dimension which cannot be experienced by the speakers, then\\n# such conventions as metaphor, allegory, and the like come to be\\n# necessary.  The \"unseen\" is described in terms which have reference`\\n# and meaning for the reader/listener.  But, like all models, a compro-\\n# mise must be made when speaking metaphorically: clarity and directness\\n# of meaning, equivalence of perception, and the like are all\\n# crippled.  But what else can you do?\\n\\n     This is why I asked the above.  How would you then\\n     know God exists as a spirit or being rather than\\n     just being metaphorical?  I mean, it\\'s okay to say\\n     \"well, Satan is just metaphorical,\" but then you\\n     have to justify this belief AND justify that God is\\n     not some metaphor for something else.\\n\\n     I say this because there are many, many instances of\\n     Satan described as a being (such as the tormentor in \\n     the Old Testament book of Job, or the temptor in the\\n     New Testament Gospels).  In the same way, God too is\\n     described as a being (or spirit.)  How am I to know\\n     one is metaphorical and not the other.\\n\\n     Further, belief in God isn\\'t a bar to evil.  Let\\'s\\n     consider the case of Satanists: even if Satan were\\n     metaphorical, the Satanist would have to believe\\n     in God to justify this belief.  Again, we have a \\n     case where someone does believe in God, but by\\n     religious standards, they are \"evil.\"  If Bobby\\n     does see this, let him address this question also.\\n\\n[deleted some more on \"metaphor\"]\\n\\n>> Obviously more philosophizing on this issue is possible, but I\\'m\\n>> not sure that the readers of this newsgroup would want to delve\\n>> into religious interpretation further.

An awful lot of the\\nstarvation and poverty in the world is directly caused by the economic\\npolicies of the Western countries, as well as by the diet of the typical\\nWesterner.  For instance, some third-world countries with terrible\\nmalnutrition problems export all the soya they can produce -- so that it can\\nbe fed to cattle in the US, to make tender juicy steaks and burgers.  They\\nhave to do this to get money to pay the interest on the crippling bank loans\\nwe encouraged them to take out.

What is the source of this pseudo-doctrine? Who is\\n> the pseudo-teacher? Who is the Great Deceiver?\\n\\nOK, here\\'s at least one Christian\\'s answer:\\n\\nJesus was a JEW, not a Christian.  In this context Matthew 5:14-19 makes\\nsense.  Matt 5:17 \"Do not think that I [Jesus] came to abolish the Law or\\nthe Prophets; I did not come to abolish, but to fulfill.\"  Jesus lived\\nunder the Jewish law.  However, He was the culmination of the promises\\nof the Prophets.  He came to *fulfill* the prophecies and fully obey\\nGod\\'s purposes.\\n\\nVerse 18 says \"For truly I say to you, until heaven and earth pass\\naway, not the smallest letter or stroke shall pass away from the Law,\\nuntil all is accomplished.\"  The key to this verse IMHO is the last \\nphrase.  Jesus, as the fulfillment of the law, \"accomplished\" what the \\nLaw was supposed to accomplish.  \\n\\nVerse 19:  \"Whoever then annuls one of the least of these commandments,\\nand so teaches others, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven;\\nbut whoever keeps and teaches them, he shall be called great in the\\nkingdom of heaven.\"  Taken in the context of Jesus teaching Jewish \\npeople about living lives under the law, this makes sense.\\n\\nIn general, it appears that Jesus is responding to some criticism he \\nmust have received about \"doing away with the Law.\"  That was not \\nJesus\\' intent at all.  He had come to earth to live the Law as it \\nshould be lived and fulfill the promises made by God to his \\npeople all the way back to Eve [Gen 3:15-The serpent will bruise your \\nheel, but *He* will bruise his head.]  Jesus appeared to be \"doing \\naway with the Law\" because he did not honor the traditions of men as \\nequal to the Law of God.  He regularly locked horns with the religious \\nleaders of the day because he would not conform to *their* rules, only \\nGod\\'s Law.\\n\\nIn the Matthew passage Jesus is defending his dedication to the Law \\nand defending himself against his accusors.  Almost the entire Sermon \\non the Mount (Matt. 5-7) is dedicated to helping the Jewish people \\nunderstand the true intent of the Law, sweeping away the clutter which \\nhad been introduced by the Pharasees and their traditions.\\n\\nIn Galatians 3:23-26, Paul describes the relationship of Jesus to the \\nLaw in this way:\\n\\n[23] But before faith came, we were kept in custody under the law, being \\nshut up to the faith which was later to be revealed.  [24] Therefore \\nthe Law has become our tutor to lead us to Christ, that we may be \\njustified by faith.  [25]  But now that faith has come, we are no \\nlonger under a tutor.  [26] For you are all sons of God through faith \\nin Christ Jesus.\\n\\nI believe this says that after Christ was revealed, the Law had \\nserved it\\'s purpose, i.e. \"our tutor to lead us to Christ,\" and\\nnow, \"we are no longer under a tutor.\"  The law has been \"fulfilled\" \\nas Christ said he would do.\\n\\nGod, the author of the old Law, and the Christ/Man, Jesus, are the same\\npersonality.  Therefore, the old Law and the new Testament (the \"last\\nwill and testament\" of Jesus) are based on the same moral principles. \\nIt makes sense that many of the principles in the old Law are\\nre-expressed in Christianity. \\n\\nOn the other hand, now that the Law has fulfilled it\\'s purpose and \\nChristians relate to God through Christ, not the Law, it also makes \\nsense that new practices and new symbolisms were established to \\nrepresent the \"mysteries\" of this new relationship.  i.e. Baptism \\nrepresenting Christ\\'s death, burial, and resurrection (Rom. 6:3-8),\\nThe Lord\\'s supper as a memorial to His sacrifice (I Cor. 11:26), and\\nSunday as a day of worship commemorating His resurrection (Matt 28:1ff,\\nActs 20:7)\\n\\nOK, That\\'s one Christian\\'s explanation.  I don\\'t claim to have all\\nthese issues completely settled even in my own mind and I welcome\\nother Christians to offer other alternatives.\\n\\nPlease excuse the long posting.

Even with precision bombing, mistakes happen and some\\ncivilians suffer.  But less civilians suffered in this war than\\nany other iany other in history!  Many Iraqi civilians went about their lives\\nwith minimal interference from the allied air raids.  The stories\\nof \"hundreds of thousands\" of Iraqi civilian dead is just plain bunk.\\nYes, bunk.

Newspaper reporters are notoriously ignorant on the subject of\\nreligion, and are prone to exaggeration in the interests of having a \"real\"\\nstory (that is, a bigger headline).\\n\\nLet\\'s back up to 1935.  At this point, we have the Masoretic text, the\\nvarious targums (translations/commentaries in aramaic, etc.), and the\\nSeptuagint, the ancient greek translation.  The Masoretic text is the\\nstandard Jewish text and essentially does not vary.  In some places it has\\nobvious corruptions, all of which are copied faithfully from copy to copy.\\nThese passages in the past were interpreted by reference to the targums and\\nto the Septuagint.\\n\\nNow, the septuagint differs from the masoretic text in two particulars:\\nfirst, it includes additional texts, and second, in some passages there are\\nvariant readings from the masoretic text (in addition to \"fixing\"/predating\\nthe various corrupted passages).  It must be emphasized that, to the best of\\nmy knowledge, these variations are only signifcant to bible scholars, and\\nhave little theological import.\\n\\nThe dead sea scroll materials add to this an ancient *copy* of almost all of\\nIsaiah and fragments of various sizes of almost all other OT books.  There\\nis also an abundance of other material, but as far as I know, there is no\\nsign there of any hebrew antecdent to the apocrypha (the extra texts in the\\nseptuagint).  As far as analysis has proceeded, there are also variations\\nbetween the DSS texts and the masoretic versions.  These tend to reflect the\\nseptuagint, where the latter isn\\'t obviously in error.  Again, though, the\\ndifferences (thus far) are not significant theologically.  There is this big\\nexpectation that there are great theological surprises lurking in the\\nmaterial, but so far this hasn\\'t happened.\\n\\nThe DSS *are* important because there is almost no textual tradition in the\\nOT, unlike for the NT.\\n-- \\nC.

Introns are removed\\nby a splicing mechanism - this would have to be present, but unused,\\nif introns are inserted. Moreover, intron insertion would have\\nrequired _precise_ targeting - random insertion would not be tolerated,\\nsince sequences for intron removal (self-splicing of mRNA) are\\nconserved.

Have an open mind.  And so end the mockery.  Gain \\nknowledge of the real God.  Put your presumptions aside.  Read the\\nBible and know that there is, truly is, a reason for everything and\\nthere exists a God that has so much love for you that the depth of it goes beyond\\nour shallow worldly experience.  A person who commits himself  \\nto seeking God, will find God.  Jesus stands at your door and knocks.  But a\\nperson who half-heartedly opens the Bible, or opens it with purpose to find \\nsomething to mock, will find, learn and see nothing.  The only thing one\\nwill gain with that attitude is folly.\\n\\nBe careful to not jump the gun, for at first glance, there are many passages\\nin the Bible that will seem bizarre and absurd.  Be assured that even\\nthough they seem alien at first, be confident that they are not.\\nBe assured that beyond your present comprehension, there lies such\\ndeep reasons that once you see them, you will indeed be satisfied. \\nI will personally guarantee that one.  As Jesus put it, \"You will never\\nbe thirsty again.  Your cup will even flow over.\"\\n\\n\\nFrom King Solomon (970 B.C. to 930 B.C.):\\n\\n    \"It is the glory of God to conceal a matter;\\n     to search out a matter is the glory of kings.\"\\n\\n\\nJesus says in John 6:44 & 55:\\n\\n   \"No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him.\"\\n\\n\\nAnd in John 3:16:\\n\\n   \"For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son,\\n   that whosoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal\\n   life.\"\\n\\n\\nYou are included in \"whosoever\".

It was well known that Rushdie was an apostate\\nlong before he wrote the offending novel and certainly there is no\\nprecedent in the Qur\\'an, hadith, or in Islamic history for indiscriminantly\\nlevelling death penalties for apostasy.\\n\\nI believe the charge levelled against Rushdie was that of \"fasad\". This\\nruling applies both within and outside the domain of an\\nIslamic state and it can be carried out by individuals.

However, the charge of \"fasad\" can encompass a\\nnumber of lesser charges. I remember that when diplomatic relations\\nbroke off between Britain and Iran over the fatwa - Iran stressed that\\nthe condemnation of the author, and the removal of the book from\\ncirculation were two preliminary conditions for resolving the\\n\"crisis\". But you are correct to point out that banning the book was not\\nthe main thrust behind the fatwa. Islamic charges such as fasad are\\nlevelled at people, not books.\\n\\nThe Rushdie situation was followed in Iran for several months before the\\nissuance of the fatwa. Rushdie went on a media blitz,\\npresenting himself as a lone knight guarding the sacred values of\\nsecular democracy and mocking the foolish concerns of people\\ncrazy enough to actually hold their religious beliefs as sacred. \\nFanning the flames and milking the controversy to boost\\nhis image and push the book, he was everywhere in the media. Then\\nMuslim demonstrators in several countries were killed while\\nprotesting against the book. Rushdie appeared momentarily\\nconcerned, then climbed back on his media horse to once again\\nattack the Muslims and defend his sacred rights. It was at this\\npoint that the fatwa on \"fasad\" was issued.\\n\\nThe fatwa was levelled at the person of Rushdie - any actions of\\nRushdie that feed the situation contribute to the legitimization of\\nthe ruling. The book remains in circulation not by some independant\\nwill of its own but by the will of the author and the publishers. The fatwa\\nagainst the person of Rushdie encompasses his actions as well. The\\ncrime was certainly a crime in progress (at many levels) and was being\\nplayed out (and played up) in the the full view of the media.\\n\\nP.S. I\\'m not sure about this but I think the charge of \"shatim\" also\\napplies to Rushdie and may be encompassed under the umbrella\\nof the \"fasad\" ruling.\\n',\n",

There is ALWAYS at least one such Divine Master \\n          (God Incarnate) PHYSICALLY ALIVE in this world AT ALL TIMES, \\n          a continuous succession THROUGHOUT HISTORY, both before and \\n          after the life of Jesus. \\n    \\n               The followers of some of these Masters founded the \\n          world\\'s major religions, usually PERVERTING the teachings of \\n          their Master in the process.  Christians, for example, added \\n          THREATS of \"ETERNAL DAMNATION\" in Hell, and DELETED the \\n          teaching of REincarnation. \\n       \\n               Secondly, and more importantly, after a particular \\n          Master physically dies and leaves this world, there is \\n          NOTHING that He can do for ANYbody except for the relatively \\n          few people that He INITIATED while He was still PHYSICALLY \\n          alive.  (THAT IS SIMPLY THE WAY GOD SET THINGS UP IN THE \\n          UNIVERSES.)                             \\n\\n               Therefore, all those Christians who worship Jesus, and \\n          pray to Jesus, and expect Jesus to return and save them from \\n          their sins, are only KIDDING THEMSELVES, and have allowed \\n          themselves to be DUPED by a religion that was mostly \\n          MANUFACTURED by the Romans. \\n      \\n               And emotional \"feelings\" are a TOTALLY DECEIVING \\n          indicator for religious validity. \\n    \\n               These things are similarly true for followers of most \\n          other major world religions, including Islam. \\n     \\n               Thirdly, the primary function of each Master is to tune \\n          His Initiates into the \"AUDIBLE LIFE STREAM\" or \"SOUND \\n          CURRENT\", (referred to as \"THE WORD\" in John 1:1-5, and as \\n          \"The River of Life\" in Revelation 22:1), and to personally \\n          guide each of them thru the upper levels of Heaven while they \\n          are still connected to their living physical bodies by a \\n          \"silver cord\". \\n    \\n               True Salvation, which completes a Soul\\'s cycles of \\n          REincarnation in the physical and psychic planes, is achieved \\n          only by reaching at least the \"SOUL PLANE\", which is five \\n          levels or universes above the physical universe, and this \\n          canNOT be done without the help of a PHYSICALLY-Living Divine \\n          Master. \\n    \\n               One such Divine Master alive today is an American, Sri \\n          Harold Klemp, the Living \"Eck\" Master or \"Mahanta\" for the \\n          \"Eckankar\" organization, now headquartered in Minneapolis, \\n          (P.O. Box 27300;  zip 55427). \\n    \\n               Another Divine Master is Maharaj Gurinder Singh Ji, now \\n          living in Punjab, India, and is associated with the \"Sant \\n          Mat\" organization. \\n      \\n               One of the classic books on this subject is \"THE PATH OF \\n          THE MASTERS\" (Radha Soami Books, P.O. Box 242, Gardena, CA  \\n          90247), written in 1939 by Dr. Julian Johnson, a theologian \\n          and surgeon who spent the last years of his life in India \\n          studying under and closely observing the Sant Mat Master of \\n          that time, Maharaj Sawan Singh Ji. \\n    \\n               Several of the Eckankar books, including some authored \\n          by Sri Paul Twitchell or Sri Harold Klemp, can be found in \\n          most public and university libraries and some book stores, or \\n          obtained thru inter-library loan.  The book \"ECKANKAR--THE \\n          KEY TO SECRET WORLDS\", by Sri Paul Twitchell, is ANOTHER \\n          classic. \\n    \\n               Many Christians are likely to confuse the Masters with \\n          the \"Anti-Christ\", which is or was to be a temporary world \\n          dictator during the so-called \"last days\".  But the Masters \\n          don\\'t ever rule, even when asked or expected to do so as \\n          Jesus was. \\n    \\n               People who continue following Christianity, Islam, or \\n          other orthodox religions with a physically-DEAD Master, will \\n          CONTINUE on their cycles of REincarnation, between the \\n          Psychic Planes and this MISERABLE physical world, until they \\n          finally accept Initiation from a PHYSICALLY-LIVING Divine \\n          Master. \\n    \\n          \\n    \\n          RE-INCARNATION\\n          \\n               The book \"HERE AND HEREAFTER\", by Ruth Montgomery, \\n          describes several kinds of evidence supporting REincarnation \\n          as a FACT OF LIFE, including HYPNOTIC REGRESSIONS to past \\n          lives [about 50% accurate; the subconscious mind sometimes \\n          makes things up, especially with a bad hypnotist], \\n          SPONTANEOUS RECALL (especially by young children, some of \\n          whom can identify their most recent previous relatives, \\n          homes, possessions, etc.), DREAM RECALL of past life experi-\\n          ences, DEJA VU (familiarity with a far off land while travel-\\n          ing there for the first time on vacation), the psychic read-\\n          ings of the late EDGAR CAYCE, and EVEN SUPPORTING STATEMENTS \\n          FROM THE CHRISTIAN BIBLE including Matthew 17:11-13 (John the \\n          Baptist was the REINCARNATION of Elias.) and John 9:1-2 (How \\n          can a person POSSIBLY sin before he is born, unless he LIVED \\n          BEFORE?!).  [ ALWAYS use the \"KING JAMES VERSION\".  Later \\n          versions are PER-VERSIONS! ] \\n          \\n               Strong INTERESTS, innate TALENTS, strong PHOBIAS, etc., \\n          typically originate from a person\\'s PAST LIVES.  For example, \\n          a strong fear of swimming in or traveling over water usually \\n          results from having DROWNED at the end of a PREVIOUS LIFE.  \\n          And sometimes a person will take AN IMMEDIATE DISLIKE to \\n          another person being met for the first time in THIS life, \\n          because of a bad encounter with him during a PREVIOUS \\n          INCARNATION. \\n\\n               The teaching of REincarnation also includes the LAW OF \\n          KARMA (Galatians 6:7, Revelation 13:10, etc.).  People would \\n          behave much better toward each other if they knew that their \\n          actions in the present will surely be reaped by them in the \\n          future, or in a FUTURE INCARNATION! \\n\\n\\n\\n          \"2nd COMINGS\"\\n\\n               If a Divine Master physically dies (\"translates\") \\n          before a particular Initiate of His does, then when that \\n          Initiate physically dies (\"translates\"), the Master will meet \\n          him on the Astral level and take him directly to the Soul \\n          Plane.  This is the ONE AND ONLY correct meaning of a 2nd \\n          Coming.  It is an INDIVIDUAL experience, NOT something that \\n          happens for everyone all at once.  People who are still \\n          waiting for Jesus\\' \"2nd Coming\" are WAITING IN VAIN. \\n    \\n          \\n          \\n          PLANES OF EXISTENCE\\n\\n               The physical universe is the LOWEST of at least a DOZEN \\n          major levels of existence.  Above the Physical Plane is the \\n          Astral Plane, the Causal Plane, the Mental Plane, the Etheric \\n          Plane (often counted as the upper part of the Mental Plane), \\n          the Soul Plane, and several higher Spiritual Planes.  The \\n          Soul Plane is the FIRST TRUE HEAVEN, (counting upward from \\n          the Physical).  The planes between (but NOT including) the \\n          Physical and Soul Planes are called the Psychic Planes. \\n    \\n               It is likely that ESP, telepathy, astrological \\n          influences, radionic effects, biological transmutations [See \\n          the 1972 book with that title.], and other phenomena without \\n          an apparent physical origin, result from INTERACTIONS between \\n          the Psychic Planes and the Physical Plane. \\n    \\n               The major planes are also SUB-DIVIDED.  For example, a \\n          sub-plane of the Astral Plane is called \"Hades\", and the \\n          Christian Hell occupies a SMALL part of it, created there \\n          LESS THAN 2000 YEARS AGO by the EARLY CATHOLIC CHURCH by some \\n          kind of black magic or by simply teaching its existence in a \\n          THREATENING manner.  The Christian \"Heaven\" is located \\n          elsewhere on the Astral Plane.  Good Christians will go there \\n          for a short while and then REincarnate back to Earth. \\n          \\n          \\n          \\n          SOUND CURRENT vs. BLIND FAITH\\n\\n               The Christian religion demands of its followers an \\n          extraordinary amount of BLIND FAITH backed up by little more \\n          than GOOD FEELING (which is TOTALLY DECEIVING). \\n       \\n               If a person is not HEARING some form of the \"SOUND \\n          CURRENT\" (\"THE WORD\", \"THE BANI\", \"THE AUDIBLE LIFE STREAM\"), \\n          then his cycles of REINCARNATION in this MISERABLE world WILL \\n          CONTINUE. \\n    \\n               The \"SOUND CURRENT\" manifests differently for different \\n          Initiates, and can sound like a rushing wind, ocean waves on \\n          the sea shore, buzzing bees, higher-pitched buzzing sound, a \\n          flute, various heavenly music, or other sounds.  In Eckankar, \\n          Members start hearing it near the end of their first year as \\n          a Member.  This and other experiences (such as \"SOUL TRAVEL\") \\n          REPLACE blind faith. \\n    \\n\\n\\n               For more information, answers to your questions, etc., \\n          please consult my CITED SOURCES (3 books, 2 addresses). \\n\\n\\n\\n               UN-altered REPRODUCTION and DISSEMINATION of this \\n          IMPORTANT Information is ENCOURAGED. \\n\\n\\n                                           Robert E.

I\\nhave seen the film called \"The Gay Agenda\" and along with my church we found\\nit to be horrifying.  Not because of what was actually shown (cleaver use of\\neditting can create any image one wants to portray), rather becaseu we are familia\\nfamiliar with how widely it was actively distributed and how many naive people\\nare actually believing the garbage found within it.  The truth is that neither\\nyou nor I can fully speak for anyone who calls themself gay, but knowing as\\nmany as I do and knowing their testimonies and witnessing thier faith and life\\nI have to say that the report you posted is a very biased report, something\\nobviously claimed against gays as well.  The truth is that unless YOU are\\ninnately gay you cannot know what harm you are causing.  I speak as an\\nabolitionist who supports affirming gay rights in our society.  I do not\\nsupport wild sex or any other misrepresentations perpetrated by Christian\\nFundamentalist extremists, but I know people who are not the sexual deviants\\nyour report paints them to be.  It is no mistake that the APA removed\\nhomosexuality from it\\'s list of mental illnesses, it is also no mistake that\\nthere are many Christians and homophobes who long to bring it back to the list.\\nI do not feel threatened by gays, I don\\'t understand why others are.\\n\\nThe following is an article concerning two of the more popular ex-gay min-\\nistries:  Exodus International & Homosexuals Anonymous.\\n\\nTHE FOUNDER OF AN \"EX-GAY\" SUPPORT GROUP CHOOSES HOMO OVER HETERO\\n\\nby Robert Pela (from Gay oriented magazine ADVOCATE)\\n\\nIn December 1985, David Caligiuri received one of The Advocate\\'s homophobia rewaa\\nawards: the A Prayer A Day Keeps the Lust Away citation.  As director of FREE\\nINDEED, a national ex-gay ministry, Caligiuri was singled out for offering\\ndiscontented gays and lesbians \"a way out of the homosexual death-style\"\\nthrough prayer.  \"I\\'d like to give the award back,\" Caligiuri now laughs, \"I\\'m\\nno longer deserve it.\"\\n  Caligiuri\\'s eight year involvement with the national \"ex-gay\" movement peaked\\nwith his founding of the Phoenix chapter of Homosexuals Anonymous (HA) as well\\nas Free Indeed.  He has since abandoned his pulpit and now says that the ex-\\ngay movement is a fruitless effort based on deception.  \"There\\'s no reality\\nin it,\" he says, \"I was selling a product, and my product was a lie.\"\\n  Headed up by national ministries like Exodus International and Courage, the\\norganizations of the ex-gay movement rely on the tenents of born-again\\nChristianity to convince disatisfied homosexuals -- usually young gay men who\\nare just coming out -- that they can shed their sexuality by suppressing their\\nsexual urges and embracing Christianity.  \"We offer support to people who are\\nseeking to leave the sin of homosexuality,\" explains Bob Davies, director of\\nExodus.  He ventures that \"about 80% of those seeking to abandon their homo-\\nsexuality are men.\"\\n  \"Anybody who is involved in the ex-gay ministry is misguided and is wasting\\ntheir time,\" says Lisa Seeley, a former \"redeemed lesbian\" who worked with\\nCaligiuri as HA and appeared with him on the Sally Jessy Raphael show.  \"These\\norganizations are for people who are spiritually and emotionally wounded.\"\\n  \"It\\'s possible to change your identity or your behavior,\" says sex educator\\nBrian McNaught, author of _On Being Gay_. \"But it\\'s really impossible to\\nchange your orientation.  These people are no longer calling themselves gay,\\nbut they continue to have same-sex erotic feelings.\"\\n  Caligiuri says he founded Free Indeed after an ominous week in 1981 when all\\nhell broke loose in his personal life.  A few days after his lover ended both\\ntheir romance and their business partnership, Caligiuri was sexually assaulted\\nby a man he picked up in a bar.  \"I was really drunk,\" he recalls, \"and I\\nwent home with this guy.  He tied me up and raped me.  He left me tied up all\\nnight, and the next morning he raped me again.\"\\n  When Caligiuri was eventually freed by the attacker, he returned home to the\\nhome he shared with his ex-lover.  \"He had another man there with him,\"\\nCaligiuri recalls.  \"I thought at this time, \\'If this is what being gay is\\nabout, I don\\'t want to be this way anymore.\"\\n  Caligiuri vowed that if he could find a way out, he would share his discovery\\nwith others.  He organized an antigay contingent to demonstrate at Phoenix\\'s\\ngay pride parade in June 1985, and a few months later Free Indeed held its\\nfirst public protest.  At a meeting to promote a gay civil rights ordinance,\\nFree Indeed members loudly blasted gays, telling them ther were sinners headed\\nfor hell.\\n  Free Indeed began receiving about a hundred telephone calls a week, thanks\\nin part to a deceptive listing in the local yellow pages.  \"We were listed\\nunder Lesbian and Gay Alternative Services,\" Caligiuri says, \"so people\\nthought we were a gay information switchboard.  People would call to find out\\nwhere the local bars were, and we\\'d preach to them about the sins of homo-\\nsexuality.\"  Ruses like this are typical of the movement, Caligiuri says,\\nadding, \"They\\'ll do anything to reach these people.\"\\n  \"David used to go on radio and say really stupid things,\" recalls Peter\\nKelly, a counselor at Phoenix\\'s Catholic diocese AIDS program, \"like that\\nhe knew he was gay when he started wearing pastel colors.\"\\n  Caligiuri\\'s family first found out about his ministry when they saw him on\\nRaphael\\'s syndicated talk show in 1985.  \"They were relieved,\" he recalls.\\n\"They figured that if they had to have a gay person in the family, better\\nthat I should be a \\'reformed\\' gay person.\"\\n  But Caligiuri was hardly reformed.  \"By the time I appeared on Sally\\'s\\nshow,\" \"I\\'d started having sex with men again.  Men would call our hotline\\nand tell me about thier latest sin: sex with their pastor, sex with their\\nfather.  I was horny all the time.\"\\n  Unable to risk going to gay bars, where he might be recognized from his\\nnumerous television appearances, Caligiuri says he \"used to go to bookstores\\nand get blowjobs.\"  When he wasn\\'t working the bookstores, he was sleeping\\nwith other \"reformed\" homosexuals.\\n  \"I didn\\'t realize it at first, but a lot of the HA leaders were having sex\\nwith one another,\" Caligiuri says.  \"We\\'d go to conferences in other cities,\\nand we\\'d be paired up in hotel rooms.  Everybody was sleeping with everybody\\nelse.\"\\n  By the time he appeared on \\'AM Philadelphia\\' television show in May 1988,\\nCaligiuri was having anonymous sex a couple times a week.  When the show\\'s\\nhost asked him if he ever \"acted on temptation,\" his answer was a lie.\\n  Caligiuri\\'s duplicity began to take it\\'s toll on him, however.  He was\\nsuffering from chrinic fatigue syndrome and candidiasis, a dibilitating\\nyeast infection, and this led to his escape from the sect.  \"I was too sick\\nto go to church,\" he explains.  \"The more time I spent away from those people\\nthe more I began to feel like myself.  I began to remember who I used to be.\"\\n  Late in 1991, Caligiuri turned Free Indeed phone lines over to a local\\nchurch and closed the ministry\\'s doors.  \"I\\'d convinced myself that there\\nis no need in the world for ex-gay people,\" he says.\\n  Today, Caligiuri, 31, is studying alternative spiritualities (\"I\\'m interest-\\ned in belief systems that aren\\'t judgemental.\"), considering romance (\"But\\nnot with a CHristian!\"), and searching for a new project to devote himself to.\\n\"I feel compelled to commit myself to gay causes,\" he says.  \"I want to\\neventually stop feeling guilty about what I did and make up for the damage I\\nmay have brought to our community.\"\\n\\n---end article---\\n\\nCaligiuri\\'s tory is by no means unique and I have read several other articles\\nof former leaders and founders of \\'ex-gay\\' ministries who have said very similar th\\nsimilar things.  Fortuantely not all of them have left Christianity, but have\\ncome to realize that God loves them despite the attitudes of others.  Some,\\nlike Chris Glaser, director of the Presbyterian \"Lazarus Project\" of West\\nHollywood Presbyterian Church have actually been working with the gay community\\nto bring them into the sheepfold of Christ and encouraging real ethical values\\nof sexuality within the sphere of being gay.  I have also, as I said talked and become\\nand become close friends with many who once attended such groups as \"Love In\\nAction\" and others, who either once claimed to have been \"reformed\" or who\\nwere too honest with themselves to live a lie, no matter who was disappointed\\nin them.  Some were even encouraged to marry as a way of \"sealing\" their\\nnew heterosexuality, only to eventually start hitting the bars, bathhouses\\nand bookstores, since these were usually activities under the concealment of\\nnight and one-night-stands of promiscuous behavior meant no continuous \"sin\"\\nthrough a committed relationship.  This is a horrible trap which the CHurch\\nhas dumped on the backs of the truly gay oriented people, and the very inno-\\ncent victims in these cases are the wives and children of such marriages.  Yet\\nthe church insists that there are only two options they are willing to allow\\ngay people: 1) heterosexuality or 2) celebacy.  This is sad.  What is also\\nmrtifying, is in the cases of those who cannot suppress their desires and\\nfear for thier sanity in such a mixed up confusion that the church forces on\\nthem, they may even opt for \\'suicide\\' or surgical dampering of the brain\\nfunctions.  In the past lobotomies and heavey drug suppressants were common-\\nplace.  There are now becoming available more and more literature on the\\nthreat of coercive Christianity toward gays, such as Sylvia Pennington\\'s\\n_\"Ex-Gays?  There Are None_. and others.  There are also a great many fact\\nbased books being written to help people trapped in this confusion such as\\nMaury Johnston\\'s _Gays Under Grace_, and Chris Glaser\\'s _Come Hom!_.  I\\nseriously recommend those for people seeking help for this persecution and\\nself-acceptance.\\n\\nThank you.\\n',\n",

The Vedas deal mostly with fruitive\\nactivities to gradually elevate the general public from the field of\\nsense gratification to a position on the transcendental plane. Arjuna,\\nas a student and friend of Lord Krsna, is advised to raise himself to\\nthe transcendental position of Vedanta philosophy where, in the\\nbeginning, there is brahma-jijnasa, or questions on the supreme\\ntranscendence. All the living entities who are in the material world are\\nstruggling very hard for existence. For them the Lord, after creation of\\nthe material world, gave the Vedic wisdom advising how to live and get\\nrid of the material entanglement. When the activities for sense\\ngratification, namely the karma-kanda chapter, are finished, then the\\nchance for spiritual realization is offered in the form of the\\nUpanisads, which are part of different Vedas, as the Bhagavad-gita is a\\npart of the fifth Veda, namely the Mahabharata. The Upanisads mark the\\nbeginning of transcendental life.\\n\\n As long as the material body exists, there are actions and reactions in\\nthe material modes. One has to learn tolerance in the face of dualities\\nsuch as happiness and distress, or cold and warmth, and by tolerating\\nsuch dualities become free from anxieties regarding gain and loss.

Whilst I\\nhave tried to be as neutral as possible regarding contentious issues, you\\nshould always remember that this document represents only one viewpoint.  I\\nwould encourage you to read widely and draw your own conclusions; some\\nrelevant books are listed in a companion article.\\n\\nTo provide a sense of cohesion and progression, I have presented this article\\nas an imaginary conversation between an atheist and a theist.  All the\\nquestions asked by the imaginary theist are questions which have been cropped\\nup repeatedly on alt.atheism since the newsgroup was created.  Some other\\nfrequently asked questions are answered in a companion article.\\n\\nPlease note that this article is arguably slanted towards answering questions\\nposed from a Christian viewpoint.  This is because the FAQ files reflect\\nquestions which have actually been asked, and it is predominantly Christians\\nwho proselytize on alt.atheism.\\n\\nSo when I talk of religion, I am talking primarily about religions such as\\nChristianity, Judaism and Islam, which involve some sort of superhuman divine\\nbeing.  Much of the discussion will apply to other religions, but some of it\\nmay not.\\n\\n\"What is atheism?\"\\n\\nAtheism is characterized by an absence of belief in the existence of God.\\nSome atheists go further, and believe that God does not exist.  The former is\\noften referred to as the \"weak atheist\" position, and the latter as \"strong\\natheism\".\\n\\nIt is important to note the difference between these two positions.  \"Weak\\natheism\" is simple scepticism; disbelief in the existence of God.  \"Strong\\natheism\" is a positive belief that God does not exist.  Please do not\\nfall into the trap of assuming that all atheists are \"strong atheists\".\\n\\nSome atheists believe in the non-existence of all Gods; others limit their\\natheism to specific Gods, such as the Christian God, rather than making\\nflat-out denials.\\n\\n\"But isn\\'t disbelieving in God the same thing as believing he doesn\\'t exist?\"\\n\\nDefinitely not.  Disbelief in a proposition means that one does not believe\\nit to be true.  Not believing that something is true is not equivalent to\\nbelieving that it is false; one may simply have no idea whether it is true or\\nnot.  Which brings us to agnosticism.\\n\\n\"What is agnosticism then?\"\\n\\nThe term \\'agnosticism\\' was coined by Professor Huxley at a meeting of the\\nMetaphysical Society in 1876.  He defined an agnostic as someone who\\ndisclaimed (\"strong\") atheism and believed that the ultimate origin of things\\nmust be some cause unknown and unknowable.\\n\\nThus an agnostic is someone who believes that we do not and cannot know for\\nsure whether God exists.\\n\\nWords are slippery things, and language is inexact.  Beware of assuming that\\nyou can work out someone\\'s philosophical point of view simply from the fact\\nthat she calls herself an atheist or an agnostic.  For example, many people\\nuse agnosticism to mean \"weak atheism\", and use the word \"atheism\" only when\\nreferring to \"strong atheism\".\\n\\nBeware also that because the word \"atheist\" has so many shades of meaning, it\\nis very difficult to generalize about atheists.  About all you can say for\\nsure is that atheists don\\'t believe in God.  For example, it certainly isn\\'t\\nthe case that all atheists believe that science is the best way to find out\\nabout the universe.\\n\\n\"So what is the philosophical justification or basis for atheism?\"\\n\\nThere are many philosophical justifications for atheism.  To find out why a\\nparticular person chooses to be an atheist, it\\'s best to ask her.\\n\\nMany atheists feel that the idea of God as presented by the major religions\\nis essentially self-contradictory, and that it is logically impossible that\\nsuch a God could exist.  Others are atheists through scepticism, because they\\nsee no evidence that God exists.\\n\\n\"But isn\\'t it impossible to prove the non-existence of something?\"\\n\\nThere are many counter-examples to such a statement.  For example, it is\\nquite simple to prove that there does not exist a prime number larger than\\nall other prime numbers.  Of course, this deals with well-defined objects\\nobeying well-defined rules.  Whether Gods or universes are similarly\\nwell-defined is a matter for debate.\\n\\nHowever, assuming for the moment that the existence of a God is not provably\\nimpossible, there are still subtle reasons for assuming the non-existence of\\nGod.  If we assume that something does not exist, it is always possible to\\nshow that this assumption is invalid by finding a single counter-example.\\n\\nIf on the other hand we assume that something does exist, and if the thing in\\nquestion is not provably impossible, showing that the assumption is invalid\\nmay require an exhaustive search of all possible places where such a thing\\nmight be found, to show that it isn\\'t there.  Such an exhaustive search is\\noften impractical or impossible.  There is no such problem with largest\\nprimes, because we can prove that they don\\'t exist.\\n\\nTherefore it is generally accepted that we must assume things do not exist\\nunless we have evidence that they do.  Even theists follow this rule most of\\nthe time; they don\\'t believe in unicorns, even though they can\\'t conclusively\\nprove that no unicorns exist anywhere.\\n\\nTo assume that God exists is to make an assumption which probably cannot be\\ntested.  We cannot make an exhaustive search of everywhere God might be to\\nprove that he doesn\\'t exist anywhere.  So the sceptical atheist assumes by\\ndefault that God does not exist, since that is an assumption we can test.\\n\\nThose who profess strong atheism usually do not claim that no sort of God\\nexists; instead, they generally restrict their claims so as to cover\\nvarieties of God described by followers of various religions.  So whilst it\\nmay be impossible to prove conclusively that no God exists, it may be\\npossible to prove that (say) a God as described by a particular religious\\nbook does not exist.  It may even be possible to prove that no God described\\nby any present-day religion exists.\\n\\nIn practice, believing that no God described by any religion exists is very\\nclose to believing that no God exists.  However, it is sufficiently different\\nthat counter-arguments based on the impossibility of disproving every kind of\\nGod are not really applicable.\\n\\n\"But what if God is essentially non-detectable?\"\\n\\nIf God interacts with our universe in any way, the effects of his interaction\\nmust be measurable.  Hence his interaction with our universe must be\\ndetectable.\\n\\nIf God is essentially non-detectable, it must therefore be the case that he\\ndoes not interact with our universe in any way.  Many atheists would argue\\nthat if God does not interact with our universe at all, it is of no\\nimportance whether he exists or not.\\n\\nIf the Bible is to be believed, God was easily detectable by the Israelites.\\nSurely he should still be detectable today?\\n\\nNote that I am not demanding that God interact in a scientifically\\nverifiable, physical way.  It must surely be possible to perceive some\\neffect caused by his presence, though; otherwise, how can I distinguish him\\nfrom all the other things that don\\'t exist?\\n\\n\"OK, you may think there\\'s a philosophical justification for atheism, but\\n isn\\'t it still a religious belief?\"\\n\\nOne of the most common pastimes in philosophical discussion is \"the\\nredefinition game\".  The cynical view of this game is as follows:\\n\\nPerson A begins by making a contentious statement.  When person B points out\\nthat it can\\'t be true, person A gradually re-defines the words he used in the\\nstatement until he arrives at something person B is prepared to accept.  He\\nthen records the statement, along with the fact that person B has agreed to\\nit, and continues.  Eventually A uses the statement as an \"agreed fact\", but\\nuses his original definitions of all the words in it rather than the obscure\\nredefinitions originally needed to get B to agree to it.  Rather than be seen\\nto be apparently inconsistent, B will tend to play along.\\n\\nThe point of this digression is that the answer to the question \"Isn\\'t\\natheism a religious belief?\" depends crucially upon what is meant by\\n\"religious\".  \"Religion\" is generally characterized by belief in a superhuman\\ncontrolling power -- especially in some sort of God -- and by faith and\\nworship.\\n\\n[ It\\'s worth pointing out in passing that some varieties of Buddhism are not\\n  \"religion\" according to such a definition. ]\\n\\nAtheism is certainly not a belief in any sort of superhuman power, nor is it\\ncategorized by worship in any meaningful sense.  Widening the definition of\\n\"religious\" to encompass atheism tends to result in many other aspects of\\nhuman behaviour suddenly becoming classed as \"religious\" as well -- such as\\nscience, politics, and watching TV.\\n\\n\"OK, so it\\'s not a religion.  But surely belief in atheism (or science) is\\n still just an act of faith, like religion is?\"\\n\\nFirstly, it\\'s not entirely clear that sceptical atheism is something one\\nactually believes in.\\n\\nSecondly, it is necessary to adopt a number of core beliefs or assumptions to\\nmake some sort of sense out of the sensory data we experience.  Most atheists\\ntry to adopt as few core beliefs as possible; and even those are subject to\\nquestioning if experience throws them into doubt.\\n\\nScience has a number of core assumptions.  For example, it is generally\\nassumed that the laws of physics are the same for all observers.  These are\\nthe sort of core assumptions atheists make.  If such basic ideas are called\\n\"acts of faith\", then almost everything we know must be said to be based on\\nacts of faith, and the term loses its meaning.\\n\\nFaith is more often used to refer to complete, certain belief in something.\\nAccording to such a definition, atheism and science are certainly not acts of\\nfaith.  Of course, individual atheists or scientists can be as dogmatic as\\nreligious followers when claiming that something is \"certain\".  This is not a\\ngeneral tendency, however; there are many atheists who would be reluctant to\\nstate with certainty that the universe exists.\\n\\nFaith is also used to refer to belief without supporting evidence or proof.\\nSceptical atheism certainly doesn\\'t fit that definition, as sceptical atheism\\nhas no beliefs.  Strong atheism is closer, but still doesn\\'t really match, as\\neven the most dogmatic atheist will tend to refer to experimental data (or\\nthe lack of it) when asserting that God does not exist.\\n\\n\"If atheism is not religious, surely it\\'s anti-religious?\"\\n\\nIt is an unfortunate human tendency to label everyone as either \"for\" or\\n\"against\", \"friend\" or \"enemy\".  The truth is not so clear-cut.\\n\\nAtheism is the position that runs logically counter to theism; in that sense,\\nit can be said to be \"anti-religion\".  However, when religious believers\\nspeak of atheists being \"anti-religious\" they usually mean that the atheists\\nhave some sort of antipathy or hatred towards theists.\\n\\nThis categorization of atheists as hostile towards religion is quite unfair.\\nAtheist attitudes towards theists in fact cover a broad spectrum.\\n\\nMost atheists take a \"live and let live\" attitude.  Unless questioned, they\\nwill not usually mention their atheism, except perhaps to close friends.  Of\\ncourse, this may be in part because atheism is not \"socially acceptable\" in\\nmany countries.\\n\\nA few atheists are quite anti-religious, and may even try to \"convert\" others\\nwhen possible.  Historically, such anti-religious atheists have made little\\nimpact on society outside the Eastern Bloc countries.\\n\\n(To digress slightly: the Soviet Union was originally dedicated to separation\\nof church and state, just like the USA.  Soviet citizens were legally free to\\nworship as they wished.  The institution of \"state atheism\" came about when\\nStalin took control of the Soviet Union and tried to destroy the churches in\\norder to gain complete power over the population.)\\n\\nSome atheists are quite vocal about their beliefs, but only where they see\\nreligion encroaching on matters which are not its business -- for example,\\nthe government of the USA.  Such individuals are usually concerned that\\nchurch and state should remain separate.\\n\\n\"But if you don\\'t allow religion to have a say in the running of the state,\\n surely that\\'s the same as state atheism?\"\\n\\nThe principle of the separation of church and state is that the state shall\\nnot legislate concerning matters of religious belief.  In particular, it\\nmeans not only that the state cannot promote one religion at the expense of\\nanother, but also that it cannot promote any belief which is religious in\\nnature.\\n\\nReligions can still have a say in discussion of purely secular matters.  For\\nexample, religious believers have historically been responsible for\\nencouraging many political reforms.  Even today, many organizations\\ncampaigning for an increase in spending on foreign aid are founded as\\nreligious campaigns.  So long as they campaign concerning secular matters,\\nand so long as they do not discriminate on religious grounds, most atheists\\nare quite happy to see them have their say.\\n\\n\"What about prayer in schools? If there\\'s no God, why do you care if people\\n pray?\"\\n\\nBecause people who do pray are voters and lawmakers, and tend to do things\\nthat those who don\\'t pray can\\'t just ignore.  Also, Christian prayer in\\nschools is intimidating to non-Christians, even if they are told that they\\nneed not join in.  The diversity of religious and non-religious belief means\\nthat it is impossible to formulate a meaningful prayer that will be\\nacceptable to all those present at any public event.\\n\\nAlso, non-prayers tend to have friends and family who pray.  It is reasonable\\nto care about friends and family wasting their time, even without other\\nmotives.\\n\\n\"You mentioned Christians who campaign for increased foreign aid.  What about\\n atheists?  Why aren\\'t there any atheist charities or hospitals?  Don\\'t\\n atheists object to the religious charities?\"\\n\\nThere are many charities without religious purpose that atheists can\\ncontribute to.  Some atheists contribute to religious charities as well, for\\nthe sake of the practical good they do.  Some atheists even do voluntary work\\nfor charities founded on a theistic basis.\\n\\nMost atheists seem to feel that atheism isn\\'t worth shouting about in\\nconnection with charity.  To them, atheism is just a simple, obvious everyday\\nmatter, and so is charity.  Many feel that it\\'s somewhat cheap, not to say\\nself-righteous, to use simple charity as an excuse to plug a particular set\\nof religious beliefs.\\n\\nTo \"weak\" atheists, building a hospital to say \"I do not believe in God\" is a\\nrather strange idea; it\\'s rather like holding a party to say \"Today is not my\\nbirthday\".  Why the fuss?  Atheism is rarely evangelical.\\n\\n\"You said atheism isn\\'t anti-religious.  But is it perhaps a backlash against\\n one\\'s upbringing, a way of rebelling?\"\\n\\nPerhaps it is, for some.  But many people have parents who do not attempt to\\nforce any religious (or atheist) ideas upon them, and many of those people\\nchoose to call themselves atheists.\\n\\nIt\\'s also doubtless the case that some religious people chose religion as a\\nbacklash against an atheist upbringing, as a way of being different.  On the\\nother hand, many people choose religion as a way of conforming to the\\nexpectations of others.\\n\\nOn the whole, we can\\'t conclude much about whether atheism or religion are\\nbacklash or conformism; although in general, people have a tendency to go\\nalong with a group rather than act or think independently.\\n\\n\"How do atheists differ from religious people?\"\\n\\nThey don\\'t believe in God.  That\\'s all there is to it.\\n\\nAtheists may listen to heavy metal -- backwards, even -- or they may prefer a\\nVerdi Requiem, even if they know the words.  They may wear Hawaiian shirts,\\nthey may dress all in black, they may even wear orange robes.  (Many\\nBuddhists lack a belief in any sort of God.)  Some atheists even carry a copy\\nof the Bible around -- for arguing against, of course!\\n\\nWhoever you are, the chances are you have met several atheists without\\nrealising it.  Atheists are usually unexceptional in behaviour and\\nappearance.\\n\\n\"Unexceptional? But aren\\'t atheists less moral than religious people?\"\\n\\nThat depends.  If you define morality as obedience to God, then of course\\natheists are less moral as they don\\'t obey any God.  But usually when one\\ntalks of morality, one talks of what is acceptable (\"right\") and unacceptable\\n(\"wrong\") behaviour within society.\\n\\nHumans are social animals, and to be maximally successful they must\\nco-operate with each other.  This is a good enough reason to discourage most\\natheists from \"anti-social\" or \"immoral\" behaviour, purely for the purposes\\nof self-preservation.\\n\\nMany atheists behave in a \"moral\" or \"compassionate\" way simply because they\\nfeel a natural tendency to empathize with other humans.  So why do they care\\nwhat happens to others?  They don\\'t know, they simply are that way.\\n\\nNaturally, there are some people who behave \"immorally\" and try to use\\natheism to justify their actions.  However, there are equally many people who\\nbehave \"immorally\" and then try to use religious beliefs to justify their\\nactions.  For example:\\n\\n  \"Here is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance: Jesus Christ\\n   came into the world to save sinners...  But for that very reason, I was\\n   shown mercy so that in me...  Jesus Christ might display His unlimited\\n   patience as an example for those who would believe in him and receive\\n   eternal life.  Now to the king eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God,\\n   be honor and glory forever and ever.\"\\n\\nThe above quote is from a statement made to the court on February 17th 1992\\nby Jeffrey Dahmer, the notorious cannibal serial killer of Milwaukee,\\nWisconsin.  It seems that for every atheist mass-murderer, there is a\\nreligious mass-murderer.  But what of more trivial morality?\\n\\n   A survey conducted by the Roper Organization found that behavior\\n   deteriorated after \"born again\" experiences.  While only 4% of respondents\\n   said they had driven intoxicated before being \"born again,\" 12% had done\\n   so after conversion.  Similarly, 5% had used illegal drugs before\\n   conversion, 9% after.  Two percent admitted to engaging in illicit sex\\n   before salvation; 5% after.\\n                                [\"Freethought Today\", September 1991, p. 12.]\\n\\nSo it seems that at best, religion does not have a monopoly on moral\\nbehaviour.\\n\\n\"Is there such a thing as atheist morality?\"\\n\\nIf you mean \"Is there such a thing as morality for atheists?\", then the\\nanswer is yes, as explained above.  Many atheists have ideas about morality\\nwhich are at least as strong as those held by religious people.\\n\\nIf you mean \"Does atheism have a characteristic moral code?\", then the answer\\nis no.  Atheism by itself does not imply anything much about how a person\\nwill behave.  Most atheists follow many of the same \"moral rules\" as theists,\\nbut for different reasons.  Atheists view morality as something created by\\nhumans, according to the way humans feel the world \\'ought\\' to work, rather\\nthan seeing it as a set of rules decreed by a supernatural being.\\n\\n\"Then aren\\'t atheists just theists who are denying God?\"\\n\\nA study by the Freedom From Religion Foundation found that over 90% of the\\natheists who responded became atheists because religion did not work for\\nthem.  They had found that religious beliefs were fundamentally incompatible\\nwith what they observed around them.\\n\\nAtheists are not unbelievers through ignorance or denial; they are\\nunbelievers through choice.  The vast majority of them have spent time\\nstudying one or more religions, sometimes in very great depth.  They have\\nmade a careful and considered decision to reject religious beliefs.\\n\\nThis decision may, of course, be an inevitable consequence of that\\nindividual\\'s personality.  For a naturally sceptical person, the choice\\nof atheism is often the only one that makes sense, and hence the only\\nchoice that person can honestly make.\\n\\n\"But don\\'t atheists want to believe in God?\"\\n\\nAtheists live their lives as though there is nobody watching over them.  Many\\nof them have no desire to be watched over, no matter how good-natured the\\n\"Big Brother\" figure might be.\\n\\nSome atheists would like to be able to believe in God -- but so what? Should\\none believe things merely because one wants them to be true?  The risks of\\nsuch an approach should be obvious.  Atheists often decide that wanting to\\nbelieve something is not enough; there must be evidence for the belief.\\n\\n\"But of course atheists see no evidence for the existence of God -- they are\\n unwilling in their souls to see!\"\\n\\nMany, if not most atheists were previously religious.  As has been explained\\nabove, the vast majority have seriously considered the possibility that God\\nexists.  Many atheists have spent time in prayer trying to reach God.\\n\\nOf course, it is true that some atheists lack an open mind; but assuming that\\nall atheists are biased and insincere is offensive and closed-minded.\\nComments such as \"Of course God is there, you just aren\\'t looking properly\"\\nare likely to be viewed as patronizing.\\n\\nCertainly, if you wish to engage in philosophical debate with atheists it is\\nvital that you give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that they are\\nbeing sincere if they say that they have searched for God.  If you are not\\nwilling to believe that they are basically telling the truth, debate is\\nfutile.\\n\\n\"Isn\\'t the whole of life completely pointless to an atheist?\"\\n\\nMany atheists live a purposeful life.  They decide what they think gives\\nmeaning to life, and they pursue those goals.  They try to make their lives\\ncount, not by wishing for eternal life, but by having an influence on other\\npeople who will live on.  For example, an atheist may dedicate his life to\\npolitical reform, in the hope of leaving his mark on history.\\n\\nIt is a natural human tendency to look for \"meaning\" or \"purpose\" in random\\nevents.  However, it is by no means obvious that \"life\" is the sort of thing\\nthat has a \"meaning\".\\n\\nTo put it another way, not everything which looks like a question is actually\\na sensible thing to ask.  Some atheists believe that asking \"What is the\\nmeaning of life?\" is as silly as asking \"What is the meaning of a cup of\\ncoffee?\".  They believe that life has no purpose or meaning, it just is.\\n\\n\"So how do atheists find comfort in time of danger?\"\\n\\nThere are many ways of obtaining comfort; from family, friends, or even pets.\\nOr on a less spiritual level, from food or drink or TV.\\n\\nThat may sound rather an empty and vulnerable way to face danger, but so\\nwhat?  Should individuals believe in things because they are comforting, or\\nshould they face reality no matter how harsh it might be?\\n\\nIn the end, it\\'s a decision for the individual concerned.  Most atheists are\\nunable to believe something they would not otherwise believe merely because\\nit makes them feel comfortable.  They put truth before comfort, and consider\\nthat if searching for truth sometimes makes them feel unhappy, that\\'s just\\nhard luck.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t atheists worry that they might suddenly be shown to be wrong?\"\\n\\nThe short answer is \"No, do you?\"\\n\\nMany atheists have been atheists for years.  They have encountered many\\narguments and much supposed evidence for the existence of God, but they have\\nfound all of it to be invalid or inconclusive.\\n\\nThousands of years of religious belief haven\\'t resulted in any good proof of\\nthe existence of God.  Atheists therefore tend to feel that they are unlikely\\nto be proved wrong in the immediate future, and they stop worrying about it.\\n\\n\"So why should theists question their beliefs? Don\\'t the same arguments\\n apply?\"\\n\\nNo, because the beliefs being questioned are not similar.  Weak atheism is\\nthe sceptical \"default position\" to take; it asserts nothing.  Strong atheism\\nis a negative belief.  Theism is a very strong positive belief.\\n\\nAtheists sometimes also argue that theists should question their beliefs\\nbecause of the very real harm they can cause -- not just to the believers,\\nbut to everyone else.\\n\\n\"What sort of harm?\"\\n\\nReligion represents a huge financial and work burden on mankind.  It\\'s not\\njust a matter of religious believers wasting their money on church buildings;\\nthink of all the time and effort spent building churches, praying, and so on.\\nImagine how that effort could be better spent.\\n\\nMany theists believe in miracle healing.  There have been plenty of instances\\nof ill people being \"healed\" by a priest, ceasing to take the medicines\\nprescribed to them by doctors, and dying as a result.  Some theists have died\\nbecause they have refused blood transfusions on religious grounds.\\n\\nIt is arguable that the Catholic Church\\'s opposition to birth control -- and\\ncondoms in particular -- is increasing the problem of overpopulation in many\\nthird-world countries and contributing to the spread of AIDS world-wide.\\n\\nReligious believers have been known to murder their children rather than\\nallow their children to become atheists or marry someone of a different\\nreligion.\\n\\n\"Those weren\\'t REAL believers.  They just claimed to be believers as some\\n sort of excuse.\"\\n\\nWhat makes a real believer?  There are so many One True Religions it\\'s hard\\nto tell.  Look at Christianity: there are many competing groups, all\\nconvinced that they are the only true Christians.  Sometimes they even fight\\nand kill each other.  How is an atheist supposed to decide who\\'s a REAL\\nChristian and who isn\\'t, when even the major Christian churches like the\\nCatholic Church and the Church of England can\\'t decide amongst themselves?\\n\\nIn the end, most atheists take a pragmatic view, and decide that anyone who\\ncalls himself a Christian, and uses Christian belief or dogma to justify his\\nactions, should be considered a Christian.  Maybe some of those Christians\\nare just perverting Christian teaching for their own ends -- but surely if\\nthe Bible can be so readily used to support un-Christian acts it can\\'t be\\nmuch of a moral code? If the Bible is the word of God, why couldn\\'t he have\\nmade it less easy to misinterpret? And how do you know that your beliefs\\naren\\'t a perversion of what your God intended?\\n\\nIf there is no single unambiguous interpretation of the Bible, then why\\nshould an atheist take one interpretation over another just on your say-so?\\nSorry, but if someone claims that he believes in Jesus and that he murdered\\nothers because Jesus and the Bible told him to do so, we must call him a\\nChristian.\\n\\n\"Obviously those extreme sorts of beliefs should be questioned.  But since\\n nobody has ever proved that God does not exist, it must be very unlikely\\n that more basic religious beliefs, shared by all faiths, are nonsense.\"\\n\\nThat does not hold, because as was pointed out at the start of this dialogue,\\npositive assertions concerning the existence of entities are inherently much\\nharder to disprove than negative ones.  Nobody has ever proved that unicorns\\ndon\\'t exist, but that doesn\\'t make it unlikely that they are myths.\\n\\nIt is therefore much more valid to hold a negative assertion by default than\\nit is to hold a positive assertion by default.  Of course, \"weak\" atheists\\nwould argue that asserting nothing is better still.\\n\\n\"Well, if atheism\\'s so great, why are there so many theists?\"\\n\\nUnfortunately, the popularity of a belief has little to do with how \"correct\"\\nit is, or whether it \"works\"; consider how many people believe in astrology,\\ngraphology, and other pseudo-sciences.\\n\\nMany atheists feel that it is simply a human weakness to want to believe in\\ngods.  Certainly in many primitive human societies, religion allows the\\npeople to deal with phenomena that they do not adequately understand.\\n\\nOf course, there\\'s more to religion than that.  In the industrialized world,\\nwe find people believing in religious explanations of phenomena even when\\nthere are perfectly adequate natural explanations.  Religion may have started\\nas a means of attempting to explain the world, but nowadays it serves other\\npurposes as well.\\n\\n\"But so many cultures have developed religions.  Surely that must say\\n something?\"\\n\\nNot really.  Most religions are only superficially similar; for example, it\\'s\\nworth remembering that religions such as Buddhism and Taoism lack any sort of\\nconcept of God in the Christian sense.\\n\\nOf course, most religions are quick to denounce competing religions, so it\\'s\\nrather odd to use one religion to try and justify another.\\n\\n\"What about all the famous scientists and philosophers who have concluded\\n that God exists?\"\\n\\nFor every scientist or philosopher who believes in a god, there is one who\\ndoes not.  Besides, as has already been pointed out, the truth of a belief is\\nnot determined by how many people believe it.  Also, it is important to\\nrealize that atheists do not view famous scientists or philosophers in the\\nsame way that theists view their religious leaders.\\n\\nA famous scientist is only human; she may be an expert in some fields, but\\nwhen she talks about other matters her words carry no special weight.  Many\\nrespected scientists have made themselves look foolish by speaking on\\nsubjects which lie outside their fields of expertise.\\n\\n\"So are you really saying that widespread belief in religion indicates\\n nothing?\"\\n\\nNot entirely.  It certainly indicates that the religion in question has\\nproperties which have helped it so spread so far.\\n\\nThe theory of memetics talks of \"memes\" -- sets of ideas which can propagate\\nthemselves between human minds, by analogy with genes.  Some atheists view\\nreligions as sets of particularly successful parasitic memes, which spread by\\nencouraging their hosts to convert others.  Some memes avoid destruction by\\ndiscouraging believers from questioning doctrine, or by using peer pressure\\nto keep one-time believers from admitting that they were mistaken.  Some\\nreligious memes even encourage their hosts to destroy hosts controlled by\\nother memes.\\n\\nOf course, in the memetic view there is no particular virtue associated with\\nsuccessful propagation of a meme.  Religion is not a good thing because of\\nthe number of people who believe it, any more than a disease is a good thing\\nbecause of the number of people who have caught it.\\n\\n\"Even if religion is not entirely true, at least it puts across important\\n messages.  What are the fundamental messages of atheism?\"\\n\\nThere are many important ideas atheists promote.  The following are just a\\nfew of them; don\\'t be surprised to see ideas which are also present in some\\nreligions.\\n\\n   There is more to moral behaviour than mindlessly following rules.\\n\\n   Be especially sceptical of positive claims.\\n\\n   If you want your life to have some sort of meaning, it\\'s up to you to\\n   find it.\\n\\n   Search for what is true, even if it makes you uncomfortable.\\n\\n   Make the most of your life, as it\\'s probably the only one you\\'ll have.\\n\\n   It\\'s no good relying on some external power to change you; you must change\\n   yourself.\\n\\n   Just because something\\'s popular doesn\\'t mean it\\'s good.\\n\\n   If you must assume something, assume something it\\'s easy to test.\\n\\n   Don\\'t believe things just because you want them to be true.\\n\\nand finally (and most importantly):\\n\\n   All beliefs should be open to question.\\n\\nThanks for taking the time to read this article.\\n\\n\\nmathew\\n\\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\\nVersion: 2.2\\n\\niQCVAgUBK8AjRXzXN+VrOblFAQFSbwP+MHePY4g7ge8Mo5wpsivX+kHYYxMErFAO\\n7ltVtMVTu66Nz6sBbPw9QkbjArbY/S2sZ9NF5htdii0R6SsEyPl0R6/9bV9okE/q\\nnihqnzXE8pGvLt7tlez4EoeHZjXLEFrdEyPVayT54yQqGb4HARbOEHDcrTe2atmP\\nq0Z4hSSPpAU=\\n=q2V5\\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\\n\\nFor information about PGP 2.2, send mail to pgpinfo@mantis.co.uk.\\nÿ\\n',\n",

The latter has also two parts:  \\n\\t2.1) The evidences of his prophethood that became manifest\\nin his own personality, his inner and outer being, his moral\\nconduct and perfection, and \\n    2.2) The miracles that: related to substantial matters.  \\nThe last part again has two branches:  \\n\\t2.2.1) Those concerning the Qur'an and spirituality, and \\n\\t2.2.2) Those relating to matter and creation.  This last \\nbranch is again divided into two categories:  \\n\\t2.2.2.1) The first involves the paranormal happenings \\nthat occured during his mission either to break the \\nstubbornness of the unbelievers, or to augment the\\nfaith of the belivers.  This category has twenty different\\nsorts, such as the splitting of the moon, the flowing of\\nwater from the fingers, the satisfying of large numbers with\\na little food, and the speaking of trees, rocks and animals\\nEach of these sons has also many instances, and thus\\nhas, in meaning, the strength of confirmation by\\nconsensus.  \\n\\t2.2.2.2)  As for the second category, this\\nincludes events lying in the future that occured as he had\\npredicted upon Allah (SWT)'s instructions.  Now starting\\nfrom the last category, we will summarize a list of them.(1)\\n\\n(1) Unfonunately, I could not write as I had intended\\nwithout choice, I wrote as my head dictated, and I could\\nnot completely conform to the order of this classification.\\n\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\\nTo be Continued Allah Willing.\\nIrfan Alan, A Servant of Islam.\\n\\n\",\n",

As he said himself:\\n\\n   The folkish-minded man, in particular, has the sacred duty, each in\\n   his own denomination, of making _people_stop_just_talking_\\n   superficially_of_God\\'s_will,_and_actually_fulfill_God\\'s_will,_and_\\n   not_let_God\\'s_word_be_desecrated._[orig. ital.]\\n\\n   For God\\'s will gave men their form, their essence, and their\\n   abilities.  Anyone who destroys His work is declaring war on the\\n   Lord\\'s creation, the divine will.  Therefore, let every man be\\n   active, each in his own denomination if you please, and let every\\n   man take it as his first and most sacred duty to oppose anyone who\\n   in his activity by word or deed steps outside the confines of his\\n   religious community and tries to butt into the other.\\n\\n   [...]\\n\\n   Hence today I believe that I am acting in accordance with the will\\n   of the Almighty Creator: _by_defending_myself_against_the_Jew,_I_am_\\n   fighting_for_the_work_of_the_Lord._[orig. ital.]\\n\\n          -- Adolf Hitler, from \"Mein Kampf\", trans. Ralph Mannheim.\\n\\nOf course, someone bad believing something does not make that belief\\nwrong.  It\\'s also entirely possible that Hitler was lying when he claimed \\nto believe in God.  We certainly can\\'t conclude that he\\'s an atheist, \\nthough.\\n\\n------------------------------\\n\\nSubject: The Bible proves it\\n\\nTypical posting:\\n\\nIn the Bible it says that...\\n\\nResponse:\\n\\nMost of the readers of alt.atheism feel that the Bible is of questionable\\naccuracy, as it was written thousands of years ago by many authors who were\\nrecording oral tradition that existed many years before.  Thus, any claimed\\n\\'truth\\' in it is of questionable legitimacy.  This isn\\'t to say that The\\nBible has no truth in it; simply that any truth must be examined before being\\naccepted.\\n\\nMany of the readers of this group also feel that because any passage is\\nsubject to \"interpretation\", any claim that a passage \\'means\\' one thing and\\none thing only is not legitimate.\\n\\nNote that this feeling tends to extend to other books.\\n\\nIt is also remarkable to many atheists that theists tend to ignore other\\nequally plausible religious books in favour of those of their own religion.\\n\\n------------------------------\\n\\nSubject: Pascal\\'s Wager\\n\\nTypical posting:\\n\\nIf you believe in God and turn out to be incorrect, you have lost nothing --\\nbut if you don\\'t believe in God and turn out to be incorrect, you will go to\\nhell. Therefore it is foolish to be an atheist.\\n\\nResponse:\\n\\nThis argument is known as Pascal\\'s Wager.  It has several flaws.\\n\\nFirstly, it does not indicate which religion to follow.  Indeed, there are\\nmany mutually exclusive and contradictory religions out there.  This is often\\ndescribed as the \"avoiding the wrong hell\" problem.  If a person is a\\nfollower of religion X, he may end up in religion Y\\'s version of hell.\\n\\nSecondly, the statement that \"If you believe in God and turn out to be\\nincorrect, you have lost nothing\" is not true.  Suppose you\\'re believing in\\nthe wrong God -- the true God might punish you for your foolishness.\\nConsider also the deaths that have resulted from people rejecting medicine in\\nfavour of prayer.\\n\\nAnother flaw in the argument is that it is based on the assumption that \\nthe two possibilities are equally likely -- or at least, that they are of \\ncomparable likelihood.  If, in fact, the possibility of there being a God \\nis close to zero, the argument becomes much less persuasive.  So sadly the\\nargument is only likely to convince those who believe already.\\n\\nAlso, many feel that for intellectually honest people, belief is based on \\nevidence, with some amount of intuition.  It is not a matter of will or \\ncost-benefit analysis.\\n\\nFormally speaking, the argument consists of four statements:\\n\\n  1. One does not know whether God exists.\\n  2. Not believing in God is bad for one\\'s eternal soul if God does\\n     exist.\\n  3. Believing in God is of no consequence if God does not exist.\\n  4. Therefore it is in one\\'s interest to believe in God.\\n\\nThere are two approaches to the argument.  The first is to view 1 as an\\nassumption, and 2 as a consequence of it.  One problem with this approach, in\\nthe abstract, is that it creates information from no information.  This is\\nconsidered invalid in information theory.  Statement 1 indicates one has no\\ninformation about God -- but statement 2 indicates that beneficial information\\ncan be gained from the absolute lack of information about God.  This violates\\ninformation entropy -- information has been extracted from no information, at\\nno \"cost\".\\n\\nThe alternative approach is to claim that 1 and 2 are both assumptions.  The\\nproblem with this is that 2 is then basically an assumption which states the\\nChristian position, and only a Christian will agree with that assumption. The\\nargument thus collapses to \"If you are a Christian, it is in your interests\\nto believe in God\" -- a rather vacuous tautology, and not the way Pascal\\nintended the argument to be viewed.\\n\\nThe biggest reason why Pascal\\'s wager is a failure is that if God is\\nomniscient he will certainly know who really believes and who believes as\\na wager.  He will spurn the latter... assuming he actually cares at all\\nwhether people believe in him.\\n\\n------------------------------\\n\\nSubject: What is Occam\\'s Razor?\\n\\nTypical posting:\\n\\nPeople keep talking about Occam\\'s Razor.  What is it?\\n\\nResponse:\\n\\nWilliam of Occam formulated a principle which has become known as Occam\\'s \\nRazor.  In its original form, it said \"Do not multiply entities \\nunnecessarily.\"  That is, if you can explain something without supposing\\nthe existence of some entity, then do so.\\n\\nNowadays when people refer to Occam\\'s Razor, they generally express it \\nmore generally, for example as \"Take the simplest solution\".\\n\\nThe relevance to atheism is that we can look at two possible explanations \\nfor what we see around us:\\n\\n1. There is an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there, which\\ncame into being as a result of natural processes.\\n\\n2. There is an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there, and \\nthere is also a God who created the universe.  Clearly this God must be \\nof non-zero complexity.\\n\\nGiven that both explanations fit the facts, Occam\\'s Razor might suggest \\nthat we should take the simpler of the two -- solution number one.\\nUnfortunately, some argue that there is a third even more simple solution:\\n\\n3. There isn\\'t an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there.  \\nWe just imagine that there is.\\n\\nThis third option leads us logically towards solipsism, which many people \\nfind unacceptable.\\n \\n------------------------------\\n\\nSubject: Why it\\'s good to believe in Jesus\\n\\nTypical posting:\\n\\nI want to tell people about the virtues and benefits of my religion.\\n\\nResponse:\\n\\nPreaching is not appreciated.\\n\\nFeel free to talk about your religion, but please do not write postings that\\nare on a \"conversion\" theme.  Such postings do not belong on alt.atheism and\\nwill be rejected from alt.atheism.moderated (try the newsgroup\\ntalk.religion.misc).\\n\\nYou would doubtless not welcome postings from atheists to your favourite\\nnewsgroup in an attempt to convert you; please do unto others as you would\\nhave them do unto you!\\n\\nOften theists make their basic claims about God in the form of lengthy\\nanalogies or parables.  Be aware that atheists have heard of God and know the\\nbasic claims about him; if the sole purpose of your parable is to tell\\natheists that God exists and brings salvation, you may as well not post it,\\nsince it tells us nothing we have not been told before.\\n\\n------------------------------\\n\\nSubject: Why I know that God exists\\n\\nTypical posting:\\n\\nI *know* from personal experience and prayer that God exists.\\n\\nResponse:\\n\\nJust as many theists have personal evidence that the being they worship\\nexists, so many atheists have personal evidence that such beings do not\\nexist.  That evidence varies from person to person.\\n\\nFurthermore, without wishing to dismiss your evidence out of hand, many\\npeople have claimed all kinds of unlikely things -- that they have been\\nabducted by UFOs, visited by the ghost of Elvis, and so on.\\n\\n------------------------------\\n\\nSubject: Einstein and \"God does not play dice\"\\n\\nTypical posting:\\n\\nAlbert Einstein believed in God.  Do you think you\\'re cleverer than him?\\n\\nResponse:\\n\\nEinstein did once comment that \"God does not play dice [with the universe]\". \\nThis quotation is commonly mentioned to show that Einstein believed in the\\nChristian God.  Used this way, it is out of context; it refers to Einstein\\'s\\nrefusal to accept the uncertainties indicated by quantum theory. Furthermore,\\nEinstein\\'s religious background was Jewish rather than Christian.\\n\\nA better quotation showing what Einstein thought about God is the following:\\n\"I believe in Spinoza\\'s God who reveals himself in the orderly harmony of\\nwhat exists, not in a God who concerns himself with fates and actions of\\nhuman beings.\"\\n\\nEinstein was unable to accept Quantum Theory because of his belief in an\\nobjective, orderly reality; a reality which would not be subject to random\\nevents and which would not be dependent upon the observer.  He believed that\\nQM was incomplete, and that a better theory would have no need for\\nstatistical interpretations.  So far no such better theory has been found,\\nand much evidence suggests that it never will be.\\n\\nA longer quote from Einstein appears in \"Science, Philosophy, and Religion, A\\nSymposium\", published by the Conference on Science, Philosophy and Religion\\nin Their Relation to the Democratic Way of Life, Inc., New York, 1941.  In\\nit he says:\\n\\n  \"The more a man is imbued with the ordered regularity of all events\\n   the firmer becomes his conviction that there is no room left by the side\\n   of this ordered regularity for causes of a different nature.  For him\\n   neither the rule of human nor the rule of divine will exists as an\\n   independent cause of natural events.  To be sure, the doctrine of a\\n   personal God interfering with natural events could never be\\n   *refuted* [italics his], in the real sense, by science, for this\\n   doctrine can always take refuge in those domains in which scientific\\n   knowledge has not yet been able to set foot.\\n\\n   But I am convinced that such behavior on the part of representatives\\n   of religion would not only be unworthy but also fatal.  For a doctrine\\n   which is to maintain itself not in clear light but only in the dark,\\n   will of necessity lose its effect on mankind, with incalculable harm\\n   to human progress.  In their struggle for the ethical good, teachers\\n   of religion must have the stature to give up the doctrine of a personal\\n   God, that is, give up that source of fear and hope which in the past\\n   placed such vast power in the hands of priests.  In their labors they\\n   will have to avail themselves of those forces which are capable\\n   of cultivating the Good, the True, and the Beautiful in humanity\\n   itself.  This is, to be sure, a more difficult but an incomparably\\n   more worthy task...\"\\n\\nEinstein has also said:\\n\\n  \"It was, of course, a lie what you read about my religous convictions,\\n   a lie which is being systematically repeated.  I do not believe in a\\n   personal God and I have never denied this but have expressed it clearly.\\n   If something is in me which can be called religious then it is the\\n   unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far as our\\n   science can reveal it.\"\\n\\nThe latter quote is from \"Albert Einstein: The Human Side\", edited by Helen \\nDukas and Banesh Hoffman, and published by Princeton University Press.  \\nAlso from the same book:\\n\\n  \"I do not believe in immortality of the individual, and I consider ethics\\n   to be an exclusively human concern with no superhuman authority behind \\n   it.\"\\n\\nOf course, the fact that Einstein chose not to believe in Christianity does \\nnot in itself imply that Christianity is false.\\n\\n------------------------------\\n\\nSubject: Everyone worships something\\n\\nTypical posting:\\n\\nEveryone worships something, whether it\\'s money, power or God.\\n\\nResponse:\\n\\nIf that is true, everyone is a polytheist.

Surely you\\ndon\\'t think all this appeared here just by chance?\\n\\nResponse:\\n\\nThis is known as the Argument From Design.\\n\\nIt is a matter of dispute whether there is any element of design in the\\nuniverse. Those who believe that the complexity and diversity of living\\ncreatures on the earth is evidence of a creator are best advised to read the\\nnewsgroup talk.origins for a while.\\n\\nThere is insufficient space to summarize both sides of that debate here.\\nHowever, the conclusion is that there is no scientific evidence in favour of\\nso-called Scientific Creationism. Furthermore, there is much evidence,\\nobservation and theory that can explain many of the complexities of the\\nuniverse and life on earth.\\n\\nThe origin of the Argument by Design is a feeling that the existence of\\nsomething as incredibly intricate as, say, a human is so improbable that\\nsurely it can\\'t have come about by chance; that surely there must be some \\nexternal intelligence directing things so that humans come from the chaos\\ndeliberately.\\n\\nBut if human intelligence is so improbable, surely the existence of a mind\\ncapable of fashioning an entire universe complete with conscious beings must\\nbe immeasurably more unlikely?  The approach used to argue in favour of the\\nexistence of a creator can be turned around and applied to the Creationist\\nposition.\\n\\nThis leads us to the familiar theme of \"If a creator created the universe,\\nwhat created the creator?\", but with the addition of spiralling \\nimprobability.  The only way out is to declare that the creator was not\\ncreated and just \"is\" (or \"was\").\\n\\nFrom here we might as well ask what is wrong with saying that the universe\\njust \"is\" without introducing a creator?  Indeed Stephen Hawking, in his book\\n\"A Brief History of Time\", explains his theory that the universe is closed\\nand finite in extent, with no beginning or end.\\n\\nThe Argument From Design is often stated by analogy, in the so-called \\nWatchmaker Argument.  One is asked to imagine that one has found a watch on\\nthe beach.  Does one assume that it was created by a watchmaker, or that it\\nevolved naturally?  Of course one assumes a watchmaker.  Yet like the \\nwatch, the universe is intricate and complex; so, the argument goes, the \\nuniverse too must have a creator.\\n\\nThe Watchmaker analogy suffers from three particular flaws, over and above \\nthose common to all Arguments By Design.  Firstly, a watchmaker creates \\nwatches from pre-existing materials, whereas God is claimed to have \\ncreated the universe from nothing.  These two sorts of creation are \\nclearly fundamentally different, and the analogy is therefore rather weak.\\n\\nSecondly, a watchmaker makes watches, but there are many other things in \\nthe world.  If we walked further along the beach and found a nuclear \\nreactor, we wouldn\\'t assume it was created by the watchmaker.  The argument \\nwould therefore suggest a multitude of creators, each responsible for a \\ndifferent part of creation.\\n\\nFinally, in the first part of the watchmaker argument we conclude that \\nthe watch is not part of nature because it is ordered, and therefore \\nstands out from the randomness of nature.  Yet in the second part of the \\nargument, we start from the position that the universe is obviously not \\nrandom, but shows elements of order.  The Watchmaker argument is thus \\ninternally inconsistent.\\n\\n------------------------------\\n\\nSubject: Independent evidence that the Bible is true\\n\\nTypical posting:\\n\\nThe events of the New Testament are confirmed by independent documentary\\nevidence.  For example...\\n\\nResponse:\\n\\nThe writings of Josephus are often mentioned as independent documentary\\nevidence.\\n\\nEarly versions of Josephus\\'s work are thought not to have mentioned Jesus or\\nJames; the extant version discusses John in a non-Christian context.  Many\\nscholars believe that the original mentioned Jesus and James in passing, but\\nthat this was expanded by Christian copyists.  Several \"reconstructions\" of\\nthe original text have been published to this effect.\\n\\nMuch information appears in the Ecclesiastical History of Eusebius (about 320\\nC.E.).  It is worthless as historical material because of the deliberate\\nfalsification of the wily Eusebius who is generally acknowledged as \\'the\\nfirst thoroughly dishonest historian of antiquity.\\' It is Eusebius who is\\ngenerally given the title of authorship for this material.\\n\\nAside from the New Testament, the biographical information about Jesus is\\nmore well-documented.  For further information, please consult the Frequently\\nAsked Questions file for the newsgroup soc.religion.christian.\\n\\n------------------------------\\n\\nSubject: Godel\\'s Incompleteness Theorem\\n\\nTypical posting:\\n\\nGodel\\'s Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates that it is impossible for the\\nBible to be both true and complete.\\n\\nResponse:\\n\\nGodel\\'s First Incompleteness Theorem says that in any consistent formal \\nsystem which is sufficiently expressive that it can model ordinary \\narithmetic, one can formulate expressions which can never be proven to be \\nvalid or invalid (\\'true\\' or \\'false\\') within that formal system.  (Technically\\nspeaking, the system must also be recursive; that is, there must be a decision\\nprocedure for determining whether a given string is an axiom within the formal \\nsystem.)\\n\\nEssentially, all such systems can formulate what is known as a \"Liar \\nParadox.\"  The classic Liar Paradox sentence in ordinary English is \"This \\nsentence is false.\"  Note that if a proposition is undecidable, the formal \\nsystem cannot even deduce that it is undecidable.\\n\\nThe logic used in theological discussions is rarely well defined, so claims\\nthat Godel\\'s Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates that it is impossible to\\nprove or disprove) the existence of God are worthless in isolation.\\n\\nOne can trivially define a formal system in which it is possible to prove the\\nexistence of God, simply by having the existence of God stated as an axiom. \\nThis is unlikely to be viewed by atheists as a convincing proof, however.\\n\\nIt may be possible to succeed in producing a formal system built on axioms\\nthat both atheists and theists agree with.  It may then be possible to show\\nthat Godel\\'s Incompleteness Theorem holds for that system.  However, that\\nwould still not demonstrate that it is impossible to prove that God exists\\nwithin the system.  Furthermore, it certainly wouldn\\'t tell us anything about\\nwhether it is possible to prove the existence of God generally.\\n\\nNote also that all of these hypothetical formal systems tell us nothing about\\nthe actual existence of God; the formal systems are just abstractions.\\n\\nAnother frequent claim is that Godel\\'s Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates\\nthat a religious text (the Bible, the Book of Mormon or whatever) cannot be\\nboth consistent and universally applicable. Religious texts are not formal\\nsystems, so such claims are nonsense.\\n\\n------------------------------\\n\\nSubject: George Bush on atheism and patriotism\\n\\nTypical posting:\\n\\nDid George Bush really say that atheists should not be considered citizens?\\n\\nResponse:\\n\\nThe following exchange took place at the Chicago airport between Robert I.\\nSherman of American Atheist Press and George Bush, on August 27 1988. Sherman\\nis a fully accredited reporter, and was present by invitation as a member of\\nthe press corps.

He is the Prophet who is revealed\\nthe last Holy Scripture, Qur\\'an, by Allah SWA (all praise be to Him)\\nthrough the Arch Angel Gabriel.  He is the seal of all prophets\\ntill the day of judgement as stated in the Qur\\'an by Allah\\nSWA (all praise be to Him).  Muhammad SAW lived between\\n571-632 AC.  All other prophethoods claimed after Muhammad SAW,\\nis a treason against Islam, against Qur\\'an, against the message\\nof Allah SWA.  Muhammad SAW is from the seed of Ishmael, another\\nmessenger of Allah and son of Abraham also a messenger of Allah.\\nHe is the Messenger that previous holy scriptures foretold his\\ncoming.  The above mentioned verse from the Qur\\'an is from \\nChapter 33, Verse 40 whose rough translation is as follows:\\n\\n\\tMuhammad is not the father of any of your men,\\n\\tbut (he is) the messenger of Allah, and the seal\\n\\tof the prophets, and Allah has full knowledge of\\n\\tall things.\\n\\n---------------------\\nCommentary on the above verse:  When a document is sealed,\\nit is complete, and there can be no further addition.  The \\nHoly Prophet Muhammad SAW closed the long line of Messengers.\\nAllah\\'s teaching is and will always be continuous, but there\\nhas been and will be NO Prophet after Muhammad SAW.  The later\\nages will want thinkers, and revivers, not Prophets.  This is not\\nan arbitrary matter.  It is a decree full of knowledge and wisdom,\\n\"for Allah has full knowledge of all things.\"\\n\\n----------------------\\nDROPLET VOL 1, No 11, Part 2\\n\\nA   D R O P L E T\\nFrom The Vast Ocean Of The Miraculous Qur\\'an\\n\\nTranslations from the Arabic and Turkish Writings of \\nBediuzzaman Said Nursi, The Risale-i Noor\\n\\nVOL 1, No 11, Part 2\\n------------------------------------------------------------------\\n   \\t\\t NINETEENTH LETTER  \\n\\n\\t\\t MU\\'JIZAT-I AHMEDIYE RISALESI \\n(A TREATISE ON THE MIRACLES OF MUHAMMED SAW)       \\n\\n(continued from Droplet Vol 1, No 11, Part 1)\\n\\n   SECOND  SIGN:   The  Noble  Messenger  (SAW)\\ndeclared His prophethood, and presented to humanity a\\ndecree as the Glorious Qur\\'an and manifest miracles\\nwhich number, according to the scholars, one thousand.\\nThe occurrence of those miracles in their entirety is as\\ncertain as the fact that He declared himself prophet.  In\\nfact, as a shown by the words of the  most obstinate\\nunbelievers quoted in various places of the Wise\\nOur\\'an, even they could not deny the occurrence of His\\nmiracles, but only called them -hasha wa kella!-(Allah forbids) \\nsorcery, in order to satisfy themselves, or to deceive their\\nfollowers.  The miracles of Muhammad (SAW) have the\\ncertainty of confirmation by consensus of Ulema (scholars\\nof Islam) to the hundreth degree.\\n   The Miracle is the conformation by the CREATOR of\\nthe universe of His declaration of Prophethood; it has the\\neffect of the words,\\'You have indeed spoken the truth !\\'\\n   Suppose that you said in the assembly of a ruler,\\nwhile being observed by Him, \\'The true ruler has\\nappointed me to such and such position.  \\'At a time when\\nyou were asked to prove your claim, the word \\'Yes\\'\\nuttered by the ruler would sufficiently support you.  Or, if\\nthe ruler changed his usual practice and attitude at your\\nrequest, this would confirm your claim even more soundly\\nand more definitely than would the word \\'Yes.\\'\\n   In the same way, ALLAH\\'s Most Noble Messenger\\nclaimed: \\'I am the envoy of the CREATOR of this\\nuniverse.  My proof is that He will change His unbroken\\norder at my request and my prayer.  Now look at my\\nfingers:  He makes them run like a fountain with five\\nspigots.  Look at the moon: by a gesture of my finger, He\\nsplits it in two.  Look at that tree: to affirm me, and to bear\\nwitness to me, it moves and comes near to me.  Look at\\nthis food: although it is barely enough for two or three\\nmen, it satisfies two or three hundred.  \\'Further he shows\\nhundreds of similar miracles.  However, the evidences  of\\nthe veracity of this high being and the proofs of his\\nprophethood are not restricted to his miracles.  All his\\ndeeds and acts, his words and behavior, his moral\\nconduct and manners, his character and appearance\\nprove to the attentive his truthfulness and seriousness.\\nIndeed, many people  such  as  Abdullah  b. Salam,  the\\nfamous scholar of the Children of Israel, came to belief\\nmerely by seeing him, and said, \\'No lie can hide in this\\nface, nor can any fraud be found in it!\\'\\n   Although many of the  researchers have concluded\\nthat the proofs of the prophethood of Muhammad and his\\nmiracles number about one thousand, there are\\nthousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands of proofs  of\\nhis prophethood.  And hundreds of thousands of\\ntruth-seeking men (muhakkikiin) with varying opinions\\nhave affirmed his prophethood in an equal number of\\nways.\\n   The Wise Our\\'an alone demonstrates thousands of\\nthe proofs of his prophethood, in addition to its own forty\\naspects of miraculousness.  Since prophethood is as a\\nphenomenon of humanity, and hundreds of thousands of\\nindividuals who claimed prophethood and performed\\nmiracles have lived and passed away; then, the\\nprophethood of Muhammad (SAW) is of a certanity\\nsuperior to that of the prophethood of all the others.  For\\nwhatever evidences, qualities  and attributes  became the\\nmeans of the prophethood and messengership of all the\\nmessengers such as Jesus (AS) and Moses (AS), they\\nare all owned in a more perfect and comprehensive\\nfashion by Muhammad (SAW).  And since the causes and\\nmeans of prophetic authority exist more perfectly in the\\nperson of Muhammad (SAW), this authority is to be found\\nin him with more certanity than all the other prophets.\\n\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\\nTo be Continued Allah Willing.\\nIrfan Alan, A Servant of Islam.\\n\\n',\n",

A fair equivalent or return for something, such as goods\\nor service. 2. Monetary or material worth. 3. Worth as measured in \\nusefulness or importance; merit. 4. A principle, standard, or quality\\nconsidered inherently worthwhile or desirable. 5. Precise meaning, as\\nof a word. 6. An assigned or calculated numerical quantity. 7. Mus. \\nThe relative duratation of a tone or rest. 8. The relative darkness or\\nlightness of a color. 9. The distinctive quality of a speech or speech\\nsound. \\n\\nIn context of a moral system, definition four seems to fit best. In terms\\nof scientific usage, definitions six or eight might apply. Note that\\nthese definitions do not mean the same thing.\\n\\nIn my mind, to say that science has its basis in values is a bit of a\\nreach. Science has its basis in observable fact. Even the usages of the\\nword \"value\" above do not denote observable fact, but rather a standard\\nof measurement. I would conclude that science does not have its\\nbasis in values, and so your statement above fails. In fact, if one\\nconcludes that a scientific set of measurements (values) are based on\\nsystems derived from observation, then it must follow that in a\\nscientific context, there is no such thing as there is no such thing as\\n\"objective values.\"\\n\\nBack to the present. This has nothing to do with a moral system anyhow.\\nJust because the word \"values\" is used in both contexts does not mean\\nthat there is a relationship between the two contexts.\\n\\nIf one is to argue for objective values (in a moral sense) then one must\\nfirst start by demonstrating that morality itself is objective. Considering\\nthe meaning of the word \"objective\" I doubt that this will ever happen.\\n\\nSo, back to the original question:\\n\\nAnd objective morality is.....?\\n\\nIf you can provide an objective foundation for \"morality\" then that will\\nbe a good beginning.\\n\\n>-- \\n>Frank O\\'Dwyer                                  \\'I\\'m not hatching That\\'\\n>odwyer@sse.ie                                  from \"Hens\",  by Evelyn Conlon\\n\\neric\\n',\n",

For sanity\\'s sake we must assume, if we believe in Him at all,\\nthat His message comes through somehow.  The question is whether it comes \\nthrough immediately to every individual, or is contained in a complex \\ncanon that must be interpreted by experts in consultation with one another, \\nor is transmitted directly through appointed representatives who are free\\nto interpret, extend and modify the canon.  If God\\'s message is indeed\\nmediated, the further problem arises as to whether the individual under-\\nstands the mediated message fully and clearly.

You might have said \"burp\", for burping and swearing carry\\nabout the same stigma today.  If you are talking about \"taking the Lord\\'s \\nname in vain\" as a serious transgression, then this example is more a case of \\nhypocrisy than of varying moral codes.\\n \\nIf there is an absolute moral code, propositions or laws in that code apply\\nabsolutely and universally, by definition.  Conceivably some moral codes\\ncould be subsets of the universal code, as you say at the outset.

Mr. England wrote the \\nfollowing as part of a book review section in This People\\'s magazine (Spring \\n1993 edition):\\n\\n  \"I conclude with a little sermon because I believe we will not be a Mormon--\\n  or human--family until we can get over labeling and rejecting each other \\n  with terms like feminist or patriarchal, liberal or conservative (Christian \\n  or non-Christian -- Hal 8^).  When we are tempted to draw a circle around\\n  a set of beliefs and traditions and styles and call it American, then exclude\\n  those who don\\'t fit, it may be well to consider that perhaps the most central\\n  defining characteristic of a good American might be \"one who doesn\\'t draw\\n  exclusive circles\" -- that the surest way of excluding ourselves from the \\n  central American ideal is by excluding others.  And when we are tempted to\\n  draw a circle around \"Mormon\" or \"Christian,\" to decide who is \"orthodox\"\\n  and who isn\\'t by how much they agree with us, it might be well to consider\\n  that the central pillar of Christ\\'s \"orthodoxy\" is our ability to love\\n  unconditionally those who are different and include them in our family.\\n\\n  \"I recently spent some time in a \"Christian\" bookstore in California. The\\n  service was excellent, the clerks and customers all smiling, neat, and\\n  well-scrubbed, and there were the expected wholesome offerings of scriptural\\n  commentaries, sentimental fiction, and collections of evangelistic sermons.\\n  But I was dismayed to find how much shelf space was given to attacking \\n  others, often viciously---whether the political left, our modern American\\n  culture, or other religions.  A whole section was devoted to \"Cults and the\\n  Occult,\" and as you might expect, Mormonism was right there under the same\\n  rubric and indictment (often by the same authors) as Satanism.  And I found\\n  I could either rent or buy (in English or Spanish) copies of The God Makers\\n  (that absurdly inaccurate, even libelous, but very popular and dangerous\\n  anti-Mormon film that uses exaclty the same techniques and even accusations\\n  of the Nazi films that scapegoated Jews in the 1930s).\\n\\n  \"It seems to me one major indication that a person is a genuine convert to\\n  Christ and his redemptive love is his lack of paranoia and anxiety (\"Perfect\\n  love casteth out fear,\" I John 4:18).  I have always been pleased that the\\n  LDS Church has not engaged in attacks on other faiths, though I find a \\n  disheartening increase in willingness of individual Mormons to engage in the\\n  same kinds of stereotyping and scapegoating---and even threats of coercive\\n  action---as the \"religious right wing\" has launched this year against the\\n  political left and American cultural and religious styles they don\\'t like.\\n  It is a fearful irony that in so doing Mormons take common cause with the\\n  very people who have most slanderously attacked Mormons---people who would,\\n  if they had power, forcefully restrict Mormons\\' rights along with those of\\n  others they believe to be evil.\"\\n\\n\\nThe above \"sermon\" was addressed to the LDS audience who usually subscribe\\nto This People\\'s magazine, but would certainly apply to all of us who\\nrely on the mercies and grace of Jesus Christ to bring us back into His\\narms.  \\n\\nEven though the LDS Church claims devine authority to exercise the principles \\nof the restored gospel---as in the days of Christ, the Church does not claim \\nperfection and infallibility in how those with authoritative status have or do \\nnow lead the Church.  I, for one, do not wish to be labelled \"Christian\", if \\nthose who profess themselves as Christians attack my beliefs because they are \\nintollerent (for example) of the way my religion may interpret Biblical \\nscriptures of the same source to have a different meaning and implication \\nthan mainstream Christianity would give it.  Once again, being in the \\nmajority does NOT in and of itself PROVE anything except that your collective \\nvoice is louder.

The most serious is that the\\nLaw was regarded by Jews at the time (and now) as binding on Jews, but\\nnot on Gentiles.  There are rules that were binding on all human\\nbeings (the so-called Noachic laws), but they are quite minimal.  The\\nissue that the Church had to face after Jesus\\' death was what to do\\nabout Gentiles who wanted to follow Christ.  The decision not to\\nimpose the Law on them didn\\'t say that the Law was abolished.  It\\nsimply acknowledged that fact that it didn\\'t apply to Gentiles.  This\\nis a simple answer, which I think just about everyone can agree to.\\n(A discussion of the issue in more or less these terms is recorded\\nin Acts 15.)\\n\\nHowever there\\'s more involved.  In order to get a full picture of the\\nrole of the Law, we have to come to grips with Paul\\'s apparent\\nrejection of the Law, and how that relates to Jesus\\' commendation of\\nthe Law.  At least as I read Paul, he says that the Law serves a\\npurpose that has been in a certain sense superceded.  Again, this\\nissue isn\\'t one of the abolition of the Law.  In the middle of his\\ndiscussion, Paul notes that he might be understood this way, and\\nassures us that that\\'s not what he intends to say.  Rather, he sees\\nthe Law as primarily being present to convict people of their\\nsinfulness.  But ultimately it\\'s an impossible standard, and one that\\nhas been superceded by Christ.  Paul\\'s comments are not the world\\'s\\nclearest here, and not everyone agrees with my reading.  But the\\ninteresting thing to notice is that even this radical position does\\nnot entail an abolition of the Law.  It still remains as an\\nuncompromising standard, from which not an iota or dot may be removed.\\nFor its purpose of convicting of sin, it\\'s important that it not be\\nrelaxed.  However for Christians, it\\'s not the end -- ultimately we\\nlive in faith, not Law.\\n\\nWhile the theoretical categories they use are rather different, in the\\nend I think Jesus and Paul come to a rather similar conclusion.  The\\nquoted passage from Mat 5 should be taken in the context of the rest\\nof the Sermon on the Mount, where Jesus shows us how he interprets the\\nLaw.  The \"not an iota or dot\" would suggest a rather literal reading,\\nbut in fact that\\'s not Jesus\\' approach.  Jesus\\' interpretations\\nemphasize the intent of the Law, and stay away from the ceremonial\\ndetails.  Indeed he is well known for taking a rather free attitude\\ntowards the Sabbath and kosher laws.  Some scholars claim that Mat\\n5:17-20 needs to be taken in the context of 1st Cent. Jewish\\ndiscussions.  Jesus accuses his opponents of caring about giving a\\ntenth of even the most minor herbs, but neglecting the things that\\nreally matter: justice, mercy and faith, and caring about how cups and\\nplates are cleaned, but not about the fact that inside the people who\\nuse them are full of extortion and rapacity.  (Mat 23:23-25) This, and\\nthe discussion later in Mat 5, suggest that Jesus has a very specific\\nview of the Law in mind, and that when he talks about maintaining the\\nLaw in its full strength, he is thinking of these aspects of it.\\nPaul\\'s conclusion is similar.  While he talks about the Law being\\nsuperceded, all of the specific examples he gives involve the\\n\"ceremonial law\", such as circumcision and the Sabbath.  He is quite\\nconcerned about maintaining moral standards.\\n\\nThe net result of this is that when Paul talks about the Law being\\nsuperceded, and Jesus talks about the Law being maintained, I believe\\nthey are talking about different aspects of the Law.  Paul is\\nembroiled in arguments about circumcision.  As is natural in letters\\nresponding to specific situations, he\\'s looking at the aspect of the\\nLaw that is currently causing trouble: the Law as specifically Jewish\\nceremonies.  He certainly does not intend to abolish divine standards\\nof conduct.  On the other hand, when Jesus commends the Law, he seems\\nto be talking the Law in its broadest implications for morals and\\nhuman relationships, and deemphasizing those aspects that were later\\nto give Paul so much trouble.\\n\\nIt\\'s unfortunate that people use the same terms in different ways, but\\nwe should be familiar with that from current conflicts.  Look at the\\nway terms like \"family values\" take on special meaning from the\\ncurrent context.  Imagine some poor historian of the future trying to\\nfigure out why \"family values\" should be used as a code word for\\nopposition to homosexuality in one specific period in the U.S.  I\\nthink Law had taken on a similar role in the arguments Paul was\\ninvolved in.  Paul was clearly not rejecting all of the Jewish values\\nthat go along with the term \"Law\", any more than people who concerned\\nabout the \"family values\" movement are really opposed to family\\nvalues.\\n',\n",

It simply\\n> means \"hang oneself\".\\n\\nActually, if you do further research as to the Greek word \"apacgw,\" you will\\nfind that it does denote success.  Those scholars did indeed have an excellent\\nreason to assume that the suicide was successful.  As I pointed out, I\\nrecently checked several Lexicons:\\n\\n\\t\"Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament,\" Louw and Nida\\n\\t\"Robinson\\'s Greek and English Lexicon of the New Testament\"\\n\\t\"Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament,\" Grimm\\n\\t\"Word study Concordance,\" Tynsdale\\n\\t\"A Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament and other \\n\\t early Christian Writings,\" Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich\\n\\t\"The New Analytical Greek Lexicon,\" Perschbacher\\n\\nA couple simply stated \"hanged oneself\", and a couple were more explicit \\nand stated that \"apacgw\" means specifically \"kill yourself by hanging.\" A\\ncouple also noted that the meaning of one the root words for \"apacgw\" is\\n\"strangle, throttle or choke\" (which pretty much invalidates the guy who\\nsuggested to David Joslin that Judas was hung upside down).  One of the best\\nreferences though, \"Robinson\\'s Greek and English Lexicon of the New\\nTestament,\" not only stated the translation, it gave both the root words, the\\nliteral translation, related greek words which use the same roots, and also\\nother presented specific examples of the word in greek literature (to give\\nfurther context).  \\n\\nThe word \"apagchw\" has two root words: \"gchw\" is the \"to strangle\" root, and\\nthe root word \"apo\" means literally \"away.\" This root words is included in\\nwords which denote a transition.  It can mean a transition in place (eg: the\\ngreek word \"apagello\" means to send a message).  \"Apo\" can also denote a\\nchange in state and specifically the change from life to death.  Robinson\\nspecifically makes comparison to the word \"apokteiuo,\" which means \"to kill.\"\\nIn literal meaning the word \"apacgw\" means \"to throttle, strangle to put out\\nof the way,\" and implicitly denotes a change in life state (ie: away from\\nlife, to death).  So while the word \"apacgw\" does mean \"to hang,\" it\\nspecifically denotes a death as well.  Thus Robinson is quite specific when he\\nstate that it means \"to hang oneself, to end one\\'s life by hanging.\" He then\\nnotes the the use of \"apacgw\" in Homers Odessy 19:230 to denote context.  He\\npresents that example of \"apacgw\" as being used to explicitly mean \"suicide by\\nhanging.\" Now since there is a perfectly good word for strangling, without the\\nadded denotation of \"death,\" and as you insist that the Bible was written by\\nGod, and every word is precicely correct, you are stuck with the complete\\nmeaning of \"apacgw\" (ie: Since the word \"apacgw\" was used, then death is\\ndenoted as the result). \\n\\nBy the way, I note that Mr DeCenso also presents an example of \"apacgw\":\\n\\n> In the Septuagint (the Greek translation of the OT used at the time of Jesus),\\n> it\\'s only used in 2 Samuel 17:23 : \"Now when Ahithophel saw that his advice \\n> was not followed, he saddled a donkey, and arose and went home to his house,\\n> to his city. Then he put his household in order, and hanged himself, and \\n> died; and he was buried in his father\\'s tomb.\"   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n> ^^^^ \\n> Notice that not only is it stated that Ahithophel \"hanged himself\" [Gr. Sept.,\\n> APAGCHO], but it explicitly adds, \"and died\".  Here we have no doubt of the\\n> result.\\n> In Matthew, we are not explicitly told Judas died.\\n\\nNote Mr DeCenso, as you say, the Septuagint was a translation from Hebrew to\\nGreek, and you have not shown the original meaning of the Hebrew (ie\" the the\\nHebrew say \"and died\"), and thus whether it was simply echoed in the Greek. \\nIt should also be pointed out that, regardless of the added \"and died\", the\\ncorrect translation would still be \"apacgw,\" as the man did indeed die from\\nstrangulation (redundant, but correct).  Further, we have evidence that the\\nSeptuagint was repeatedly rewritten and reedited (which included versions\\nwhich contradicted each other), and such editing was not even necessarily\\nexecuted by Greeks.  Thus I am not sure that you can use the Septuagint as it\\nnow stands, as a paragon of ancient greek.  So, what you really need to prove\\nyour point Mr DeCenso, is an example, in ancient greek, of someone committing\\n\"apacgw\" and surviving.  Otherwise I would see you as simply making worthless\\nassertions without corresponding evidence. \\n\\nNow I would note Mr DeCenso, that everytime I go out of my way to research it\\none of your apparently contrived exegisis, I pretty much find it false.  Thus,\\nI think that if you are going to add to the text, something over and above\\nwhat the source clearly says, then you had better have an explicit Greek or\\nhistorical source to justify it. \\n\\nBy the way, as to Mr Rose\\'s statement about trees around the Potter\\'s Field:\\n\\n> There are still trees around the ledges and a rocky pavement at the bottom.\\n\\nUnless Mr Rose can show that these trees are two thousand years old, or that\\nthere are 2000 year old stumps there, or has a 2 thousand year old description\\nof the area which mentions such trees, then it is inappropriate for him to\\nassert that the present placement of trees prove the location of the trees two\\nthousand years ago (after all, things change). \\n\\nNow as to your other argument, ie: that the money Judas used is not the same\\nas the 30 silvers:\\n\\n> As to your second question Mr DeCenso, you ask how we could be sure that the\\n> money with which Judas purchased the land, was indeed for the betrayal, rather\\n> than some other source.  I would point out that in Acts, where it specifically\\n> mention \"the reward of iniquity\" [Acts 1:18], it also specifically mentions\\n> what act of iniquity they were talking about (ie: Acts 1:16 \"...concerning\\n> Judas who was guide to those who arrested Jesus.\").  Now I would point out\\n> that when the Bible describes an act of \"iniquity,\" and then immediately\\n> discusses \"*the* reward of iniquity,\" it would be rather inane to suggest that\\n> it was an action of iniquity other than the one discussed.\"\\n> \\n>  \\n> Notice that in verse 16, the word \"iniquity\" is not used.  Rather, it states\\n> that Judas \"became a guide to those who arrested Jesus\".\\n> But the writer DID NOT stop there...vs. 17, \"for he was numbered with us and\\n> obtained a part in this ministry.\"  What part did Judas play in their ministry?\\n>          ^^^^^^\\n\\nTrue, Peter (or the author of Acts) does not specifically call Judas\\' betrayal\\n\"an iniquity,\" but for that matter, neither does John specifically call Judas\\'\\nactions \"an iniquity\" either.  Further John 13:29 did not say that Judas took\\nthe money box, but rather said:\\n\\n    \"Some thought that because, Judas had the money box, Jesus was telling\\n     him \"Buy what we need for the feast\"; or that he should give something\\n     to the poor, So after receiving the morsel he immediately went out, and\\n     it was night.\"\\n\\nNote that it is said that Judas left, it does not say that he took the money\\nbox.  Thus when I see your explanation it still seems to me you would choose\\nthe a an unproven iniquity, mentioned by another author, in a different\\nbook, written at a different time, over the iniquity explicitly mentioned by\\nthe author of acts.  I find this forced and contrived. \\n\\nOf course this particular argument becomes moot, since we have have seen\\nevidence that \"apacgw\" means suicide.  You see, since Judas\\' hanging was\\nsuccessful, he could not have spent the money mentioned in John 13:29, because\\nMatthew and Mark explicitly say the betrayal was on the high holy day (ie:\\nPassover), and thus he could not have spent the money before killing himself\\nthe next day.  Thus the money which bought the \"Field of Blood\" would have to\\nhave been the 30 pieces of silver (Of course he got the 30 pieces of silver\\nthat night as well, and thus couldn\\'t have spent that either.  Oh dear, I\\nbelieve that the house of cards is comming down). \\n\\nMaybe we should at this point, discuss now whether Jesus was crucified on\\nFriday or Saturday as that is now part of the argument about Judas.\\n\\nBy the way, as to where the prophesy of the Potter\\'s field came from (ie: the\\nmention of it in Matthew), you say:\\n\\n> Please, when we are done with this study on his death, remind me to discuss\\n> this with you.\\n\\nI am reminding you now to discuss it now. It\\'s all part of the same verse we\\nare discussing, and I wish you would quit procrastinating and sidestepping \\nthese issues.\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLater,\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDave Butler\\n\\n\\tA wise man proportions his belief to the evidence.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDavid Hume, Philosopher\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAn Inquiry Concerning Human Understanding\\n\\n    PS.

Christian people have caused\\n\"objective morality\" to look very \"relative.\"  After all, that was the\\npoint of the original question in this thread, i.e. can we toss out\\nChristianity because it is so obviously inconsistent with its own\\nprinciples?  If you will bear with me, I will attempt to explain this\\napparent inconsistency from at least one Christian\\'s viewpoint:\\n\\nIf God exists and is the creator of mankind as the Bible claims, then\\nHe has a pretty well-defined concept of what makes people tick\\nphysically, emotionally, etc.  GOD has an \"objective\" morality for us.\\nThat is to say, He has no trouble understanding what is good for (or\\ndetrimental to) the creature He created. \\n\\n\\tGalatians 2:10-- For we [mankind] are His workmanship, created in\\n\\tChrist Jesus for good works [a morality], which God prepared\\n\\tbeforehand [a well-defined design], that we might walk in them.\\n\\nHowever, contrary to what many people assume (including the Pharasees\\nof the Bible,) God\\'s morality cannot be completely codified in a list\\nof rules and regulations.  To some extent, every activity of a\\nperson\\'s life creates a new situation to which morality must be\\napplied.  There never could be enough volumes to codify God\\'s\\n\"objective\" morality for us. \\n\\nThroughout history, mankind has tried to reduce morality to a list of\\nrules (objectivity, if you please.)  In the Old Testament, we have\\nboth principles and specific rules.  By the time of Jesus, most of the\\nprinciples were obscured by the emphasis men had placed on the rules.\\nVolumes of additional rules had been made to try to codify the\\napplication of the principles.  We [mankind] weren\\'t comfortable with\\nthe \"subjectivity\" of principles. \\n\\n\\tFor reference see Matthew 5 where Jesus explains the difference\\n\\tbetween the Law and the principles of the Law.  For example, in\\n\\tverses 21-22:  \"You have heard that the ancients were told,\\n\\t\\'You shall not commit murder\\'...and \\'Whoever commits murder shall\\n\\tbe liable to the court.\\'  But I say to you that everyone who is\\n\\tangry with his brother shall be liable to the court...\"\\n\\nThe \"objective morality\" of God gets blurred by our inept\\ninterpretation of it.  We [Christians] have made our biggest errors\\nwhen we have allowed any one person or group of people decide EXACTLY\\nwhat God intended for us.  If we [Christians] would stay committed to\\nseeking God\\'s will instead of trying to prove we already had it all\\nfigured out, we might do a better job of allowing others to find God\\'s\\n\"objective morality\" for themselves.  If Jesus is who he said he\\nwas/is (and that\\'s the fundamental question,) then HE IS \"objective\\nmorality.\" \\n\\nJohn Nunnally\\n',\n",

Once again, to not believe in God is different than saying  \\nI BELIEVE that God does not exist. I still maintain the position, even \\nafter reading the FAQs, that strong atheism requires faith.\\n\\nBut first let me say the following.\\nWe might have a language problem here - in regards to \"faith\" and\\n\"existence\". I, as a Christian, maintain that God does not exist.\\nTo exist means to have being in space and time. God does not HAVE\\nbeing - God IS Being. Kierkegaard once said that God does not\\nexist, He is eternal. With this said, I feel it\\'s rather pointless\\nto debate the so called \"existence\" of God - and that is not what\\nI\\'m doing here. I believe that God is the source and ground of\\nbeing. When you say that \"god does not exist\", I also accept this\\nstatement - but we obviously mean two different things by it. However,\\nin what follows I will use the phrase \"the existence of God\" in it\\'s\\n\\'usual sense\\' - and this is the sense that I think you are using it.\\nI would like a clarification upon what you mean by \"the existence of\\nGod\".\\n \\nWe also might differ upon what it means to have faith. Here is what\\nWebster says:\\n\\nfaith \\n1a: allegiance to duty or a person: LOYALTY\\nb  (1): fidelity to one\\'s promises\\n   (2): sincerity of intentions\\n2a (1): belief and trust in and loyalty to God\\n   (2): belief in the traditional doctrines of a religion\\nb  (1): firm belief in something for which there is no proof\\n        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n   (2): complete trust\\n3: something that is believed esp. with strong conviction; esp: a system \\n   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\nof religious beliefs\\nsyn see BELIEF\\n\\n\\n\\nOne can never prove that God does or does not exist. When you say\\nthat you believe God does not exist, and that this is an opinion\\n\"based upon observation\", I will have to ask \"what observtions are\\nyou refering to?\" There are NO observations - pro or con - that\\nare valid here in establishing a POSITIVE belief. All observations\\ncan only point you in a direction - a direction that we might even\\nbe predisposed to (by predisposed I mean, for example, people whoes \\npartents \"believe in God\" also tend to). To actually draw a conclusion\\nabout the \"existence\" or \"non-existence\" of God requires a leap - and\\nyou have made this leap when you actively say \"I believe that God  \\ndoes/does not exist\". Personally, I think that both statements are\\nmisguided. Arguing over the \"existence\" of God is precisely the wrong way\\nto find Him (and yes, I use \"Him\" because a personal God is the only \\nviable concept (IMO) - if a person wants to use \"She\" go ahead. Of course \\nGod is neither He nor She - but we have no choice but to \\nanthropomorphise. If you want me to explain myself further I\\'ll be \\nglad to.) \\n\\n\\n\\nAnd please, if someone does not agree with me - even if they violently \\ndisagree - it\\'s in no ones advantage to start name calling.

It is evident that the West, especially America,\\nmisjudged Hussein drastically.  But once Hussein invaded Kuwait and \\nthreatened to militarily corner a significant portion of the world\\'s\\noil supply, he had to be stopped.  Sure the war could have been\\nprevented by judicious and concerted effort on the part of the West\\nbefore Hussein invaded Kuwait, but it is still *Hussein* who is\\nresponsible for his decision to invade.

It is precisely the lessons the world learned\\nin WW2 that motivated the Western alliance to war.

No man can have access to maternity leave,\\nNO MATTER HOW HARD HE TRIES TO GET PREGNANT.  I hope this is clear.\\n\\nMaternity leave is an example where a sexist law is just, because the\\nsexism here just reflects the \"sexism\" of nature in making men and women\\ndifferent.  There are many other differences between men and women which\\nare far more subtle than pregnancy, and to find out more of these I\\nrecommend you have a look at the book \"Brainsex\".\\n\\nYour point that perhaps some day men can also be pregnant is fallacious.\\nIf men can one day become pregnant it will be by having biologically\\nbecome women!

You\\nare saying that men can have the sexist maternity leave privilege that \\nwomen can have if they also become women -- which actually just supports\\nmy statement that maternity leave is sexist.\\n\\n>The discrimination comes in when a woman is denied opportunities\\n>because of her (legally determined) sexual inferiorities.  As I\\n>understand most religious sexual discrimination, and I doubt that\\n>Islam is exceptional, the female is not allowed into the priestly\\n>caste and in general is subjugated so that she has no aspirations to\\n>rights which, as an equal human, she ought to be entitled to.\\n\\nThere is no official priesthood in Islam -- much of this function is\\ntaken by Islamic scholars.  There are female Islamic scholars and\\nfemale Islamic scholars have always existed in Islam.  An example from\\nearly Islamic history is the Prophet\\'s widow, Aisha, who was recognized\\nin her time and is recognized in our time as an Islamic scholar.\\n\\n>No matter how sweetly you coat it, part of the role of religions\\n>seems, historically, to have served the function of oppressing the\\n>female, whether by forcing her to procreate to the extent where\\n>there is no opportunity for self-improvement, or by denying her\\n>access to the same facilities the males are offered.\\n\\nYou have no evidence for your blanket statement about all religions, and\\nI dispute it.  I could go on and on about women in Islam, etc., but I\\nrecently reposted something here under the heading \"Islam and Women\" --\\nif it is still at your news-site I suggest you read it.  It is reposted\\nfrom soc.religion.islam, so if it has disappeared from alt.atheism it\\nstill might be in soc.religion.islam (I forgot what its original title\\nwas though).  I will email it to you if you like. \\n\\n>The Roman Catholic Church is the most blatant of the culprit,\\n>because they actually istitutionalised a celibate clergy, but the\\n>other religious are no different: let a woman attempt to escape her\\n>role as child bearer and the wrath of god descends on her.\\n\\nYour statement that \"other religions are no different\" is, I think, a\\nstatement based simply on lack of knowledge about religions other than\\nChristianity and perhaps Judaism.\\n\\n>I\\'ll accept your affirmation that Islam grants women the same rights\\n>as men when you can show me that any muslim woman can aspire to the\\n>same position as (say) Khomeini and there are no artificial religious\\n>or social obstacles on her path to achieve this.\\n\\nAisha, who I mentioned earlier, was not only an Islamic scholar but also\\nwas, at one stage, a military leader.\\n\\n>Show me the equivalent of Hillary Rhodam-Clinton within Islam, and I\\n>may consider discussing the issue with you.\\n\\nThe Prophet\\'s first wife, who died just before the \"Hijra\" (the\\nProphet\\'s journey from Mecca to Medina) was a successful businesswoman.\\n\\nLucio, you cannot make a strong case for your viewpoint when your\\nviewpoint is based on ignorance about world religions.\\n\\n Fred Rice\\n darice@yoyo.cc.monash.edu.au   \\n',\n",

The scribe Matthew is perhaps\\nthe most eager to draw out what he thinks are prophetic answers in\\nthe career of Jesus of Nazareth.  As you will see, Matthew\\'s main\\nstrategy is to take various Old Testament passages, often not even\\nabout the promised Messiah, and apply them to the circumstances in\\nthe New Testament.  We must also bear in mind the question of the\\nauthenticity of the accounts.  Since the gospels were written at\\nleast 35 years after Jesus was executed, we do not know how much\\nhappened exactly as stated.  But, for purposes of analysis, we\\nwill take particular claims at face value.\\n\\nImmanuel:\\n\\n       We begin, of course, at the beginning.\\n\\n       (Mt 1.21-22):  \"[Mary] will bear a son, and you,\\n       Joseph, will name him \\'Jesus\\' (which means G\\'d is\\n       salvation), for he will save his people from their\\n       sins.\"  All this happened to fulfil what the lord had\\n       spoken by a prophet:\\n\\n       [Isaiah 7.1-16]:  In the days of Ahaz (c. 750 BCE),\\n       king of Judah, Rezin of Syria and Pekah of Israel made\\n       war on Jerusalem (capitol of Judah), but could not\\n       quite conquer it.  When the house of David (i.e. Ahaz\\n       and his court in Judah) were told of this, ...its\\n       heart and the heart of its people shook...   And, the\\n       lord G\\'d said to Isaiah, \"go to meet with Ahaz...\" \\n       ...And the lord spoke to Ahaz (through prophet Isaiah,\\n       naturally) saying, \"Ask a sign of G\\'d your lord.  It\\n       can be as deep as Sheol or as high as heaven.\"  But,\\n       Ahaz said, \"I won\\'t ask; I will not put the lord to a\\n       test.\"  Then (Isaiah) said, \"Hear then, O house of\\n       David.  Is it not enough for you to weary men, that\\n       you must weary my god too?  Therefore, the lord\\n       himself will give you a sign:  Behold, a young woman\\n       is with child and will bear a son, and name him\\n       \"Immanuel,\" which means, \"G\\'d is with us.\"   He will\\n       eat curds and honey when he knows how to refuse evil\\n       and choose good.  For, before the child knows how to\\n       refuse evil and choose good, the land of the two kings\\n       you dread will have been deserted...\\n\\nMatthew homes in on just the sentence that is in italics. \\nFurther, he the Hebrew word \"almah,\" (young woman), as\\nspecifically, \"virgin.\"  But, this is not a prophecy about the\\nMessiah.  It is not a prophecy about an event to happen 750 years\\nlater.  It is not a prophecy about a virgin (bethulah) mother.  In\\nshort, it not about Jesus.  Matthew has made use of a verse out of\\ncontext, and tries to make it fit the specific case of Mary.  It\\nshould be noted that if we want to read the prophecy in a general\\nmanner, a very general one, it can be made to fit Mary.  Mary,\\nvirgin or not, was indeed a young woman with child.  Of course,\\nthe fit is shady and has problems.  Jesus, while thought of by\\nlater Christians to be G\\'d walking among men, was never called by\\nthe name, Immanuel.  If Christianity wished to claim this prophecy\\nfor Jesus, it becomes at best a cut-and-paste prophecy... a second\\nclass prophecy.   Not too convincing.\\n\\nEgypt:\\n\\n       After Jesus\\'s birth in Bethlehem, Matthew tells about a\\nquick (and elsewhere unmentioned) excursion to Egypt, as if he\\nwishes to liken Jesus to Moses.  This was done to escape an\\nalleged infanticidal rampage of the king, Herod.\\n\\n       [Mt 2.15]  ...and remained there until the death of\\n       Herod.  This was to fulfil what the lord had spoken:\\n       \"Out of Egypt I have cal-led my son.\"\\n\\n\\nWhat the lord really said was this.\\n\\n       [Hosea 11.1]  When Israel was a child, I loved him. \\n       And, out of Egypt I called my son.  The more I called\\n       them (my people), the more they went from me; they\\n       kept sacrificing to the Ba\\'als, and kept burning\\n       incense to idols.\\n\\nMatthew conveniently omits the rest of Hosea\\'s oracle.  But, it\\nwas indeed Israel that, once called out of Egypt, wanted to\\nreturn.  This is history.  Jesus is certainly not being spoken of\\nhere.  And, if we are to draw some kind of parallel here, we wind\\nup with a Jesus that flees and resists G\\'d.   Again, this prophecy\\nis just not as convincing as Matthew probably had hoped.\\n\\nRachel Weeps:\\n\\n        While Jesus is off vacationing in Egypt, Matthew says that\\nKing Herod sought to kill him, and thus ordered the executions of\\nall young male children.  Matthew then writes,\\n\\n       [Mt 2.17-18]   By this, that which was spoken by the\\n       prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled:\\n\\n       \"A voice was heard in Ramah, wailing and loud\\n       lamentation-- Rachel weeping for her children;\\n       she refused to be consoled, because they were\\n       no more.\"   \\n\\nThe reference is to a passage in Jeremiah 31.15, referring to the\\ncarrying off of Israel into exile by Sargon (of Assyria) in 722\\nBCE.  Rachel, the ancestor of the major tribes of Israel, Ephraim,\\nand Manasseh, is said to weep for her descendants who are \"no\\nmore.\"  It is metaphorical, of course, since Rachel lived and dies\\nbefore the Hebrews were even in the Egyptian exile.\\n       It is interesting to note that it was Leah, not Rachel, who\\nwas the ancestor of the Judeans (the land where Jesus and\\nBethlehem were).  If anyone should do weeping for her \"children,\"\\nit is Leah.  The only connexion that Rachel has with Bethlehem is\\nthat the legends have it that she was buried north of the city,\\n\"on the way to Ephrath, (Bethlehem).\"\\n       As for Herod and his infanticide, it is rather unlikely\\nthat such an event actually occurred.  One never knows, but the\\nevent is not mentioned or alluded to anywhere else in the Bible,\\nnor is it mentioned in any of the secular records of the time. \\nHerod was particularly unliked in his reign, and many far less\\nevil deeds of Herod were carefully recorded.  This might be a\\nprime example of how events were added to Jesus\\'s life to enhance\\nthe message of the church\\'s gospel.\\n       Because of the whole story\\'s similarity to the tale of the\\ninfant Moses in Egypt, it is highly likely that it is a device set\\nup by Matthew to add prophetic, yet artificial, approval of Jesus.\\nIt is not surprising that Matthew conveniently neglects to mention\\nthe rest of the Jeremiah quote.   The \"children\" the prophet\\nspeaks of are not dead, but exiled in the Assyrian Empire.  G\\'d\\ncomforts the weeping Rachel, saying that the children will be\\nreturned-- he will gather them back together.  Of course, this\\nwould not suit Matthew\\'s purpose, as the children he speaks of are\\ndead for good.  Again, the \"prophecy\" Matthew sets up is not even\\nthat, and to anyone who bothers to check it out, is not too\\nconvincing.\\n\\nThe Nazarene:\\n\\n       We do not even have to go to the next chapter to find\\nanother Matthean prophecy.  After leaving Egypt, Joseph & wife\\ntake the infant Jesus to live in the city of Nazareth, \\n\\n       [Mt 2.23]  ...that what was spoken of by the prophets\\n       might be fulfilled, \"He shall be called a Nazarene.\"\\n\\nFirst thing we notice is that Matthew does not mention the name of\\nthe prophet(s) this time.  Second, we have to ask who \"He\" is. \\nThere are no Messianic prophecies speaking of a Nazarene.  Worse,\\nthere are no prophecies, period, mentioning a Nazarene.  Still\\nworse, there are no Nazarenes mentioned in the Old Testament at\\nall.  In the book of Judges, an angel tells Samson\\'s mother that\\nshe will,\\n\\n       [Judges 13.5]  \"...conceive and bear a son.  No razor\\n       shall tough his head, for he will be a Nazirite to his\\n       god from the day of his birth.  He will deliver Israel\\n       from the hands of the Philistines.\"\\n\\nThis is of course not a prophecy of Jesus, or the messiah of G\\'d. \\nBut, it is the best that can be found.  Obviously, Matthew has\\nbegun to go overboard in cut-and-paste prophecies, in that he is\\nsimple making them up now.\\n\\nBearing our\\nDiseases:\\n\\n       Jesus next goes around healing people of physical illnesses\\nand disabilities.\\n\\n       [Mt 8.17]   This was to fulfil what was spoken by the\\n       prophet Isaiah, \"He took our infirmities and bore our\\n       diseases.\"\\n\\nAs expected, the verse quoted in Isaiah is quoted out of context,\\nand a few words are skewed to fit the Christian scheme.  We have,\\n\\n       [Is 53.4]  Surely he, [the suffering servant], has\\n       borne our sickness, and carried our pains.\\n\\nFrom a reading of the surrounding passages in Isaiah, we know that\\nthe prophet is speaking in present tense of the collective nation\\nof Israel, Jehovah\\'s chosen servant and people.  He speaks to the\\nIsraelites suffering in exile, in the voice of the gentile nations\\nthat look upon it.  This image is deeply ingrained in Jewish\\nidentity --an image of a chastised, yet cherished, Israel as the\\ninstrument of the nations\\' salvation by G\\'d.\\n      The verses speak of Israel taking on the sicknesses which\\nare the literal and metaphorical manifestations of guilt and\\ndiscipline.  They do not speak of a \"servant\" going around and\\nhealing people.  Notice that the servant in Isaiah takes on the\\nsicknesses and pains of the nations (and individual Jews).  Jesus,\\nas we all know, did not take the diseases onto himself.  The\\nverses here in Isaiah are not a prophecy of something to come, but\\nrather something that had already happened.  While it is believed\\nthat Jesus took on the eternal punishment of hell, he did not bear\\nthe illnesses he healed.  So, while someone might want to say\\nthat, figuratively, Jesus reenacted the deeds of Israel in his\\nspiritual atonement, he has to admit that Matthew\\'s parallel\\nmisses where he intended it to have its effect.\\n\\n\\nSilent Messiah:\\n\\n      Upon healing multitudes of commoners, it is said that Jesus\\nordered them to keep quiet, presumable so that he wouldn\\'t arouse\\nthe attention of the local rulers.\\n\\n       [Mt 12.15-21]  This was to fulfill what was spoken by\\n       the prophet Isaiah.   \\n\\n       \"Behold my servant whom I have chosen, my beloved,\\n       with whom my soul is pleased.  I will put my spirit on\\n       him, and he will announce justice to the Gentiles.  He\\n       will not wrangle or cry aloud, nor will anyone hear\\n       his voice in the streets.  He will not break a bruised\\n       reed or quench a smoldering wick until he brings\\n       justice to victory, and the gentiles will hope in his\\n       name.\"\\n\\nThe Isaiah passage quoted reads,\\n\\n       [Is 42.1-4]  Behold my servant whom I uphold, my\\n       chosen, in whom my soul delights.  I have put my\\n       spirit on him, and he will bring forth justice to the\\n       nations.  We will not cry or lift up his voice, or\\n       make it heard in the street.  He will not break a\\n       bruised reed, or quench a smoldering wick.  He will\\n       faithfully bring forth justice.  He will not fail\\n       (burn dimly) or be discouraged (bruised) until he has\\n       established justice in the earth.  And the coastlands\\n       await his law.\\n\\nYou see, Matthew has conveniently left out part of the passage,\\nbecause it does not suit the dealings of Jesus.  Christians could\\nnever think of Jesus failing, never would the \"light\" of mankind\\nburn dimly.  But, the servant nation of Israel will indeed come to\\nan end when its job is done.  When the gentiles come to embrace\\nG\\'d there will no longer be a chosen people, but rather all will\\nbe the children of G\\'d.  Also, the ending phrase has been changed\\nfrom the Judaic \"...the coastlands await his law.\" to the\\nChristologic, \"the Gentiles will hope in his name.\"   While the\\noriginal proclaims the Torah law of Jehovah, the other rewrites it\\nto fit its strange doctrine of \"believing in the name.\"  If one\\nhas any doubt the servant referred to is not Jesus, one has only\\nto read the whole chapter, Isaiah 42, and hear about the beloved\\nbut blind and imperfect servant, \"a people robbed and\\nplundered...\"   So, we see that when Matthew\\'s attempt at\\n\"prophecy\" is examined, it crumbles.\\n\\nThree Days and\\nThree Nights:\\n\\n      Now we come upon a prophecy supposedly uttered by the very\\nmouth of the god Jesus himself.  He speaks of his crucifixion and\\nresurrection.\\n\\n       [Mt 12.40]   For as Jonah was in the belly of the\\n       whale for three days and three nights, so will the Son\\n       of Man be in the heart of the earth three days and\\n       three nights.\\n\\nBefore any further discussion can occur, it is necessary to know\\nhow the Jews understood days.  As far as day names went, each was\\n24 hours long, lasting from sunset 6pm to the following sunset\\n6pm.  What was referred to as a \"day\" was the period of light from\\n6am to the ending sunset at 6pm.  Thus, according to our time\\nscale, a sabbath day began at 6pm Friday evening, and lasted until\\n6pm saturday evening.  This is why the Jews celebrate their\\nsabbath on the daylight portion of Saturdays, instead of Sundays. \\n(It seems like a real miracle that Christians didn\\'t forget that\\nSaturday was indeed the seventh and last day of the week!)  Thus,\\nwhen days and nights are referred to together, 12 hour daylight\\nportions and 12 hour night periods are being spoken of.  Thus,\\nJesus says that he will be in the grave, or in hell, or otherwise\\nunresurrected for three days and three nights.\\n\\n      As the good book tells us, Jesus was crucified on the \"ninth\\nhour,\" which is 3pm, Friday afternoon.  He then was put into the\\ngrave sometime after that.  Then, Jesus left the grave, \"rose,\"\\nbefore dawn of what we call Sunday (The dawn after the sabbath was\\nover).  What this means is that Jesus was, using our time for\\nclarity, in the grave from 6pm Friday night to some time before\\n6am Sunday morning.  We could also add a little time before 6pm\\nFriday, since the bible is not specific here.  What this means\\nusing Jewish time is that he was in the grave for one day, two\\nnights, and possibly a couple of hours of one day.  Certainly this\\nis a problem for Jesus prediction.  There is absolutely no way we\\nare even able to have his death involve three days and three\\nnights --even using modern time measurements.   We then are led to\\nsuspect that this error is another one of Matthew\\'s little\\nmistakes, and that the gospel writer put false words into his\\ngod\\'s mouth.   And no matter who made the prediction, it is more\\nthan unconvincing... it is counter-convincing.\\n\\nHearing &\\nUnderstanding:\\n\\n     Jesus tool on a habit of speaking to his vast audiences in\\nparables-- stories in which a deeper meaning could be found, if\\nyou were already one of the elect, those chosen to understand the\\nmessage of Jesus.  He reasons that those who can understand the\\nparables are the ones he wants.  If the people cannot understand\\nthem, there is no need to bother with them, since they will not\\naccept the \"plain\" message any better.  Matthew says,\\n\\n       [Mt 13.14-16]  With them [the audience] indeed in\\n       fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah which says, \\n\\n       \"You will indeed hear but never understand; and you\\n       will indeed see, but never perceive.  Because this\\n       people\\'s heart has grown dull, their ears are heavy of\\n       hearing, and they have shut their eyes so the they\\n       would not perceive with them, her with their ears, and\\n       understand with their heart, and turn for me to heal\\n       them.\"\\n\\nThe original Isaiah passages are part of his earlier works, his\\ncall to the ministry.  This is in 740 BCE, when Israel is\\nflourishing, right before it falls under the authority of Assyria. \\nIsaiah sees the good times ending, and also a vision from G\\'d,\\ncalling him to bring reform to Israel and Judah.\\n\\n       [Is 6.9-13]  And G\\'d said, \"Go, and say to this\\n       people, `Hear and hear, but do not understand; see and\\n       see, but do not perceive.\\'   Make the heart of this\\n       people fat, make their ears heavy, and shut their\\n       eyes, so they will not see with their eyes, or hear\\n       with their ears, and understand with their hearts, and\\n       turn and be healed.\"  Then Isaiah said, \"How long,\\n       lord?\"  And he said, \"Until the cities lie waste\\n       without inhabitant, and houses without men, and the\\n       land is utterly desolate, and the G\\'ds take men far\\n       away, and forsaken places are many in the land.  And\\n       though a tenth will remain in it, it will be burned\\n       again, like a terebinth or an oak whose stump still\\n       stands when the tree is felled.\" The holy seed is its\\n       stump.\\n\\nHere we see that it is really G\\'d who causes the people of Israel\\nto stop listening to the prophet\\'s warnings, but reaffirms the\\npromise made to Solomon\\'s (and David\\'s) seed/lineage.  If you read\\nthe rest of Isaiah, you find that this is done to fulfil the plan\\nof G\\'d to use Israel as a servant, a light to the nations.  (Look\\nat Isaiah 42.18-25, 48.20, 49.3)\\n     We see that Matthew has cut-and-pasted just a little portion\\nof Isaiah\\'s verse, to suit his own gospel needs.  More than that,\\nhe has altered the words, to make it fit the people who didn\\'t\\nunderstand Jesus\\'s stories.  And, as we see, Isaiah\\'s verses are\\nnot prophecies, but rather commands from G\\'d to him, in the\\npresent.   Once again, Matthew\\'s prophecy falls flat on its face. \\n\\n     Matthew tries again to make Jesus\\'s parables look like they\\nhave the prophetic approval.\\n\\n       [Mt 13.35]  ...he said nothing to them without a\\n       parable.  This was to fulfil what was spoken of by the\\n       prophet, \"I will open my mouth to them in parables.  I\\n       will utter that which has been hidden since the\\n       foundation of the world.\"\\n\\nMatthew really botches up here.  He attempts to quote not from a\\nprophet, but from the Psalms.\\n\\n       [Ps 78.2-4]  I will open my mouth in parable.  I will\\n       utter dark sayings of old, things that we all have\\n       heard and known, things that our fathers have told us. \\n       We will not hide them from their children, but tell to\\n       the coming generation the glorious deeds of the\\n       lord...\\n\\nAs was pointed out, the verses in the Psalms do not really come\\nfrom a prophet.  You might also want to know that earlier copies\\nof Matthew\\'s gospel even inserted Isaiah\\'s name as this prophet. \\nApparently, later scribes caught the error and tried to cover some\\nof it up.\\n     Perhaps the most significant part of this is that, once\\nagain, Matthew has altered the Old Testament Scriptures.  As Jesus\\nhas said earlier, he speaks in parables so that some will not\\nunderstand them.  The parables in the Psalms are not to be hidden. \\nFurther, they speak of things \"known, that our fathers have told\\nus.\"  Jesus deals with things \"hidden since the foundation of the\\nworld.\"  Indeed Jesus dealt in a lot of secrecy and confusion. \\nThis is in direct opposition to the parables in the Psalms.  No\\nwonder Matthew had to rewrite them!   And still once again,\\nMatthew\\'s artificial prophecies fall flat on their face.  But,\\nChristians rarely look at this.  Matthew\\'s prophecies aren\\'t the\\nonly things about Christianity that are beginning to look bad.\\n\\n\\nExcuses of\\nLittle Faith:\\n\\n       In Mt. 17.14-21, we see that the disciples are able to go\\naround casting out demons, except in one case.  Not knowing what\\nepilepsy was, the people thought those with the disease were\\npossesed with demons.  It is no wonder that the disciples were\\nunable to \"dispossess\" the epileptic.  But, Jesus, perhaps no more\\nenlightened than they, is reported to have rebuked them, saying\\nthey didn\\'t have enough faith.   This seems strange.  Why was this\\ndemon special?  It seems that either a true believer has faith or\\nhe does not.  Apparently, enough faith will allow someone to move\\nmountains.  Of course, you will find no one, these days that can\\nmove real mountains.  No one parts seas.  The only miracles the\\nCharismatics can speak of are those rumoured to happen on trips to\\nMexico or some faraway place.  Major miracles are making some old\\nwoman\\'s arthritis feel better on Sunday morning T.V.\\n\\n       And the gods, including Jesus, are always shrouded in\\nancient lore and writings, protected from the skeptics in their\\nsacred pasts.  They are either dead, sleeping, or hiding in\\nheaven, with people rumouring about their imminent return and\\ntheir great miracles of days long gone.  Yet, life goes on.  \\n\\n     Tales of mystics, stories of miracles-- all in a distant time\\nor a distant place.  Gods used to reveal themselves to men in the\\nold days, Jehovah too.  But, now they are silent.  All the\\ntheologians give are various excuses as to why we don\\'t get to see\\nGod anymore.\\n\\n       We\\'re too lazy; we\\'re not zealous enough; we\\'re\\n       sinful; it\\'s just his \"plan\"; we put too many of our\\n       own demands on G\\'d\\'s appearance; if we had the right\\n       faith, if we  were willing to meet G\\'d on his terms...\\n\\n     Yet, even the most pious of men have not seen G\\'d.  You, dear\\nreader, have not seen G\\'d.  Not literally, you know that to be\\ntrue. (I know that\\'s presumptuous and bold.  But, searching your\\nheart, you know what I mean.)  All that we\\'ve seen religions do is\\nmake people feel good and content about not seeing G\\'d.  They say\\nour little faith does not merit us to see G\\'d.  Sometimes, they\\nsay, \"See the love in these people you worship with... see the\\nlives of people change... that is seeing G\\'d.\"   Thus people get\\nlulled to sleep, satisfied with turning G\\'d into the everyday\\nsights.   But, that is not seeing G\\'d as I am speaking of... it is\\nnot seeing G\\'d the way people used to see.  \\n      What we see in the world that is good, is the compassion of\\nhuman hearts, the love given and taken by men and women, the\\nforgiveness practised by Christian & Atheist alike, beauty created\\nby the mind of man.  These are the things that are done; these are\\nwhat we see.  But, it is said this is so only because everybody\\nhas little faith.\\n\\x0c\\nJesus Rides on\\nan Ass:\\n\\n       Shortly after accepting the role of the Jewish messiah\\nking, Jesus requests a donkey be brought in for him to ride into\\nJerusalem.  \\n\\n       [Mt 21.5]  This took place to fulfil what was spoken\\n       by the prophet, saying,\\n\\n       Tell the daughter of Zion, \"Behold, your king is\\n       coming to you, humble, mounted on an ass, and on a\\n       ass-colt.\"\\n\\nOf course, the passage quoted from Zechariah 9.9 reads a little\\ndifferently.\\n\\n       Lo, your king comes to you; he is triumphant and\\n       victorious, humble, and riding on an ass, on an ass-\\n       colt... he will command peace to the nations.\\n\\nThere isn\\'t all that much difference here, except that Zechariah\\nonly involves one animal  --an ass-colt--  while Matthew reads the\\npoetic wording slightly differently.  Thus, he has Jesus call for\\nboth a colt and an adult ass.  From Matthew\\'s version, we get a\\ncomical picture of the divine Christ sweating it to straddle two\\ndonkeys.  This could inevitably lead to a theological,\\nproctological dilemma!   We find that in the account written\\nearlier by St. Mark, only the colt was called for and brought to\\nJesus.  This indeed fits the verses of Zechariah properly, and\\nshows us that in Matthew attempt to use prophetic verses, he has\\nbungled.  Now, excluding many respectable Christians I have met, I\\nhave noticed that while Christ is thought to have ridden on asses,\\nthe situation is often reversed nowadays...\\n\\n       Then, entering the Jerusalem temple, the priests were\\nangered at people and youngsters calling Jesus the messiah.  But,\\nJesus replied as we might expect Matthew to have done,\\n\\n       [Mt 21.16]  Haven\\'t you read?  `Out of the mouth of\\n       babes and sucklings thou has brought perfect praise.\\'\\n\\nIt is more likely that Matthew made this response up since Jesus\\nwas never one to point out such little \"prophetic\" things AND\\nsince, as we might expect, the quote is in error, which seems to\\nfit Matthew\\'s track record quite well.  We might ask Jesus or\\nMatthew, \"Haven\\'t you read?\" for the source reads,\\n\\n       [Psalms 8.1-2]  O YaHWeH our lord, how majestic is\\n       your name in the whole world!   You, whose glory is\\n       chanted above the heavens by babes and infants, you\\n       have founded a bulwark against your foes to still the\\n       enemy and the avenger.\\n\\nThe passages hardly need comment.  There is no \"perfect praise\"\\nspoken of in the psalm, and what praise is there is given to G\\'d,\\nnot his messiah king, and not Jesus.  As mentioned, it seems to be\\njust one more case of Matthew\\'s pen making up convenient prophetic\\nscripture.\\n\\nYHVH said to \\nmy lord...:\\n\\n      Jesus is said to have asked from whom the promised Jewish\\nmessiah-king is to be descended.  The Jews agree-- it is king\\nDavid.  But, then Jesus counters by quoting Psalms 110,\\n\\n       \"The LORD said to my Lord, sit at my right hand, until\\n       I put your enemies under your feet.\"\\n\\nTaken at face value, Jesus is denying the necessity of Davidic\\ndescent.  One assumes he is in opposition to their answer.  Of\\ncourse, the Christian answer is that he agrees, but is trying to\\nmake some hidden point, to reveal some mystery about the divine\\nnature of the messiah-king.  It\\'s tempting to believe this, if one\\nis a Christian and not interested in matters of investigation. \\nBut, there are problems.\\n       In Jesus\\'s time, the psalm was thought to be about the\\nmessiah.  And, it is easy to see why David might refer to the\\nmessiah as his superior.  We need only look at the scriptures\\nabout the messiah to see that he is expected to be a great king,\\nbringing the Jews to times even better than those under David\\'s\\nrule.  Of course, the Jews listening had no good answer, and the\\npassage could indeed refer to a divine messiah, such as the\\nChristians worship.  The problem lies in the meaning of this\\npsalm, an error that apparently several Jews of Jesus\\'s time had\\nalso made.  One must remember that there were various factions\\namong the Jews, often as a result of different expectations of the\\nmessiah-king.  Jesus was apparently one of these adventists, like\\nhis audience, who thought the messiah\\'s advent was imminent, and\\nwho interpreted Psalms 110, among others, as being messianic.\\nWhat is the problem, then?  Psalm 110 literally reads,\\n\\n       YHVH\\'s utterance to my lord:\\n\\t\"Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your\\n       footstool.\"\\n\\n       YHVH sends forth your mighty scepter from Zion.  Rule\\n       in the midst of your foes!  Your people will offer\\n       themselves freely on the day you lead your host on the\\n       holy mountains.  \\n\\n       \"You are a priest of the order of Melchizedek\\n       forever.\"\\n\\nThe word \"lord\" is often mistakenly capitalised by Christian\\nbibles to denote divinity in this lord.  But, in the Hebrew, the\\nword is \"adoni,\" and no capitalisation exists.  Adoni simply means\\n\"lord,\" a generic term as we would use it.  It is used often in\\nthe scriptures to refer to kings and to G\\'d.  It is merely an\\naddress of respect.  \\n      There is nothing in the text itself to imply that the word\\nrefers either to divinity or to the messiah-king.  That this is\\nsupposed to be written by David is not certain.  The title of the\\npsalm translates to either \"a psalm of David,\" or \"a psalm about\\nDavid.\"  It seems fitting to assume it to be written by a court\\npoet, about David\\'s covenant and endorsement from G\\'d.  If the\\npsalm had been written by David, it is unlikely that he would be\\ntalking about the messiah.  The idea of a perfect king, descended\\nfrom David, was not present in David\\'s age.  We have extensive\\ntales of David\\'s doings and sayings-- none of which include any\\npraises of a messiah.\\n     Many of the psalms show evidence of being written long after\\nDavid was dead, in times of the exile when G\\'d had put his show of\\nfavour for David\\'s kingdom on hold.  \\n     The description in the psalm fit David very well.  David was\\npromised by G\\'d a rise to power, victory over his enemies,\\nsuccessful judgement among the nations he conquered.  He achieved\\nthe priesthood common to Melchizedek in being a righteous king,\\nenabled to bless the people.   It all fits.\\n      We do not have to blame this problem on Matthew alone,\\nthough.  Here, there is not artificial prophecy alluded to, though\\nhis use of the scripture is rather questionable.  Still, this\\nevent is common to the other gospels too.  So, we let Matthew off\\na little more easily this time.  It is interesting to note,\\nthough, how Matthew dresses up the event.  The earlier gospel of\\nMark tells the tale with Jesus simply speaking to a crowd. \\nMatthew has the Pharisees, who became the religious competition of\\nan infant Christianity, be the target of Jesus\\'s question.  As we\\nmight expect, Matthew writes that the event ends up by\\nembarrassing the Pharisees.  Such power is the pen.\\n\\nMoses & Jesus,\\nHad it Together\\nAll Along...:\\n\\n       We leave the gospel story of Matthew momentarily to see a\\npseudo-prophecy in John\\'s gospel.  The gospel story of John\\ndeserves special treatment, because it seems to be so far removed\\nfrom the real events of Jesus\\'s career as told by even Matthew. \\nBut, for the moment, we will just look at one verse.  The early\\nchurch leaders founded a religion on the Jewish hopes of a messiah\\nking, and on an artificial extension of the original promises made\\nby G\\'d.  When constructing the history of Abraham, Moses wrote of\\na promise of land and nationhood to the Jewish people.  While this\\nwas accomplished eventually, under the rule of king David, the\\nChristians who came along later decided that they would claim the\\nfulfillment of the promise.  But, to do so, they expanded on the\\npromise, preaching about a heavenly kingdom.\\n\\n       [John 8.56] (J.C. speaking) Your father, Abraham,\\n       rejoiced to see My day.  He say it and was glad.\\n\\nIt would be nice to tie in approval for Jesus from Abraham, but,\\nAbraham knew nothing of Jesus or a messiah, or anything Christian. \\nI have tried, and failed to find any event in the Old Testament\\nwhich corresponds to John\\'s little prophecy.  It is par for the\\ncourse to see St. John making up Old Testament backings, just like\\nhis forerunner Matthew.  Many Christians know that their faith has\\nmany of its foundations in such fraud, and it is surprising they\\nstill cling to it.\\n\\nThe Potter\\'s\\nField:\\n\\n      We are told that Jesus was betrayed while in Jerusalem by\\none of his followers, Judas Iscariot.   Matthew writes,\\n\\n       [Mt 27.5-10]  And throwing down the pieces of silver\\n       in the temple, [Judas] departed... But, the chief\\n       priests, taking the silver, said, \"It isn\\'t lawful for\\n       us to put it in the treasury, since it is blood\\n       money.\"  So they... bought a potter\\'s field with it to\\n       bury strangers in... Then was fulfilled what was\\n       spoken by the prophet Jeremiah,\\n\\n       \"And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price\\n       of him on whom a price had been set by some of the\\n       sons of Israel, and they gave them for the potter\\'s\\n       field, as the lord directed me.\"\\n\\nThis prophecy is an utterly gross bastardisation of Old Testament\\nScripture.  First, Matthew has made a mistake regarding the name\\nof the prophet.  It is Zechariah who utters the verses which\\nMatthew makes use of.\\n\\n       [Zech. 11.12-13]  ...And they weighed out my wages,\\n       thirty shekels of silver.  Then YHVH said to me, \"Cast\\n       them to the treasury,\" --the lordly price at which I\\n       was paid off by them.  So I took the thirty shekels of\\n       silver and cast them into the treasury in the house of\\n       YHVH.\\n\\nFirst of all, the verses of Zechariah do not deal with a betrayer\\nof the messiah, or of G\\'d.  The deal with a shepherd, most likely\\na priest, chosen to serve a function of presiding over the people\\nshortly before G\\'d would send Judah and Israel into conflict with\\none another.  The word, \"treasury,\" had been replaced by the King\\nJames Scholars with \"to the potter,\" precisely because this made\\nMatthew\\'s quote fit better.  But, this is a blatant error.  The\\ncorrect translation of the Hebrew is indeed \"treasury,\" which also\\nmakes perfect sense in Zechariah\\'s context, whereas \"potter\\'s\\nfield\" is totally unrelated.  Whether the mistranslation was\\nintentional or not seems to be beyond speculation.  However, given\\nMatthew\\'s track record, one finds it hard to resist the notion of\\nintentional dishonesty.\\n      Of course, Matthew would have ample reason for altering the\\ntext.  The thirty pieces of silver match Judas\\'s situation, and if\\nas most Christians seem to be, the reader is willing to disregard\\nthe contextual incongruity, Matthew might have another prophecy to\\ntoss around.  However, the correct translation of Zechariah\\ndirectly contradicts the situation with Judas and the high\\npriests.  The high priests would not put the money in the\\ntreasury.  The worthless shepherd of Zechariah does exactly the\\nopposite!  Of course, to the average Thursday-Night Bible student,\\nthe \"prophecy\" as presented by Matthew would be taken at New\\nTestament face value.  To those, Matthew\\'s work is convincing\\nenough.\\n\\nWine, Vinegar,\\n& Casting Lots:\\n\\n      Then, Jesus is led away to be crucified.\\n\\n       [Mt 27.34-35]  ...they gave him vinegar to drink,\\n       mingled with gall; but when he tasted it, he would not\\n       drink it.  And, when they had crucified him, they\\n       divided his garments among them by casting lots: that\\n       it might be fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet,\\n\\n       \"They parted my garments among them, and upon my\\n       vesture did they cast lots.\"\\n\\nFirst of all, the vinegar offered to Jesus is actually common sour\\nwine, of the type that Roman soldiers drank regularly.  We find\\nthat right before Jesus dies, the soldiers themselves give him\\nsome to drink --not polluted with gall.\\n\\n       [Jn 19.28-30]  Jesus... said, \"I thirst.\"  A bowl of\\n       vinegar stood there, so they put a sponge full of the\\n       vinegar on hyssop and held it to his mouth.  When he\\n       had received the vinegar, he said, \"It is finished;\"\\n\\nBut, Matthew seems to be drawing on, not a passage from the\\nprophets, but one from the Psalms.\\n\\n       [Ps 69.20-28]  I looked for pity, but there was none;\\n       and for comforters, but I found none.  They gave me\\n       poison for food (lit. they put gall in my meat), and\\n       for my thirst, they gave me vinegar to drink...  Add\\n       to them punishment upon punishment, may they have no\\n       acquittal from thee.  Let them be blotted out of the\\n       Book of the Living.\\n\\nOf course, the sour wine offered to Jesus is done at his request\\nof drink.  This does indeed seem to be a show of pity.  The psalm\\nquoted is about David and his political and military enemies.  It\\nis not about the messiah or Jesus.  It is then not surprising that\\nwe run into further problem when we see that the \"Jesus\" in the\\npsalm asks G\\'d for the damnation of the \"crucifiers,\" whereas the\\nJesus of the gospels says,\\n\\n       [Lk 23.34]  Jesus said, \"Father, forgive them, the\\n       don\\'t know what they do!\"\\n\\nFurther, Matthew misses with his attempt to create prophecy by\\nhaving gall (a bitter substance) put into Jesus\\'s drink, not his\\nmeat, as the psalm stipulates.\\n\\n       With the \"prophecy\" of the vinegar faulty, we naturally\\nask, \"What of the casting of lots?\"  This brings up the 22nd\\nPsalm, which deserves discussion all by itself.  Suffice it now to\\nsay that the fact that Jesus\\'s clothes were divided as told is no\\ngreat thing.  It turns out that this happened often to any felon\\nin those days.  As we will soon see, it is perhaps the least\\nerroneous passage of the psalm when applied to Jesus.  It does\\nindeed bring up the interesting question as to the quality of\\nJesus\\'s clothes.  For a man so removed from worldly possessions,\\nhis ownership of clothes worthy of casting lots raises some\\nsuspicions.\\n\\nThe 22nd Psalm:\\n\\n      This psalm is attributed to David, as a lament of his\\ncondition under the attack of his enemies.  It becomes a song of\\npraise to YHVH and of hope.  Taken out of context, parts of it\\nseem to fit the plight of Jesus at the crucifixion quite well.  We\\nwill examine the primary passages.\\n\\n       Verse 1-2:  My god, my god! why have you forsaken me?! \\n       Why are you so far from helping me, far from the words\\n       of my groaning?  Oh, my god, I cry by day, but you\\n       don\\'t answer, and by night, but find no rest.\\n\\nJesus is said to have cried the first sentence while on the cross. \\nThis suggests that the whole psalm is really about Jesus, rather\\nthan king David.  Of course, the rest of the first stanza does not\\nfit as nicely to Jesus or his execution.  Jesus is not pictured as\\ncomplaining about the whole ordeal, he is supposed to be like \"the\\nlamb led mute before its shearers.\"  Indeed, Jesus doesn\\'t do much\\ngroaning, even when on the cross.  He certainly does not cry by\\nboth day and night on the cross.\\n\\n       6-8:  But, I am a worm, and no man-- scorned by men... \\n       All who see me mock at me.  They make faces and wag\\n       their heads;  \"He committed his cause to YHVH.  So let\\n       him deliver him... for he delights in him.\"\\n\\nThis seems to fit Jesus\\'s execution pretty well, with the\\nexception of the Holy messiah being called a worm.\\n\\n       12-13:  Many bulls encompass me... they open their\\n       mouths widely at me like a ravening and roaring lion.\\n\\n       16-18:  Yea, dogs are round about me, a company of\\n       evildoers encir-cle me, they have pierced my hands and\\n       feet.  I can see all my bones... They divide my\\n       garments among them, and cast lost for my raiment.\\n\\n       19-21:  But you, YHVH, be not far away!  ...Deliver my\\n       soul from the sword, my life from the power of the\\n       dog!  Save me from the mouth of the lion, and my\\n       afflicted soul from the horns of the wild bull!\\n\\nIt would seem quite convincing, and I\\'m sure the early Christian\\nfathers who wrote of this prophecy thought so too.  Unfortunately,\\nthis prophecy has a fatal flaw.  The words \"have pierced\" really\\ndo not exist in the psalm.  The correct Hebrew translation is,\\n\\n       16:  Yea, dogs are round about me, a company of\\n       evildoers encircles me, like the lion, they are at my\\n       hands and feet...\\n\\nIn Hebrew the phrase \"like the lion\" and a very rare verb form\\nwhich can mean \"pierced\" differ by one phonetic character.  The\\nword in the Hebrew text is literally, \"like the lion\" (ka\\'ari),\\nwhich makes sense in the context, and even further fits the animal\\nimagery employed by the psalm writer.  It is convenience that\\nwould urge a Christian to change the word to \"ka\\'aru.\"   But, to\\nadd the needed (yet artificial) weight to the \"prophecy\" this is\\njust what the Christian translators have chosen to do.  While the\\ncorrect translation does not eliminate the psalm from referring to\\nJesus, its absence does not say much for the honesty of the\\ntranslators.\\n\\n       Apart from the erroneous verse 16, the psalm does not lend\\nitself to Jesus so easily.  Verse 20 speaks of the sufferer being\\nsaved from a sword rather than a cross.  This naturally fits the\\npsalm\\'s true subject, king David.  As a side note, we now know\\nthat crucifixions did not pierce the hands, the palms, but rather\\nthe forearms.  This doesn\\'t say much in favour of the traditional\\nthought of a resurrected Jesus showing his disciples the scars on\\nhis palms.  But then, facts aren\\'t bound by our religious beliefs.\\n\\n      Matthew escapes culpability this time, as he does not\\nattempt to draw many direct links between this psalm and his lord\\nJesus.  But the psalm, like many others, was on the minds of all\\nthe gospel writers when they compiled the stories and\\ninterpretations of Jesus\\'s life and death.  How much these\\nscriptures may have contributed to what actually got written down\\nis a question that has serious repercussions for Christian\\ntheology.  It is easy to see, for those who are not faithful\\nfundamentalists, how some of the events in the New Testament might\\nhave been \"enhanced\" by scribes such as the eager Matthew.  But,\\nit does less to speculate than to simply investigate scriptural\\nmatters and prophetic claims.  So far, this has not said good\\nthings for St. Matthew.\\n\\nThe reference to the piercing looks a lot like Jesus\\'s\\ncrucifixion.  John\\'s gospel recount, written about 70 years after\\nthe fact, tells us at Jesus\\'s execution,\\n\\n       [Jn 19.34,37]  But one of the soldiers pierced his\\n       side with a spear, and out came blood and water...\\n       these things took place that Scripture be fulfilled...\\n       \"The will look on him whom they\\'ve pierced.\"\\n\\nOf course, this is built on a passage taken blatantly out of\\ncontext.   Prophet Zechariah tells us how much of the nation of\\nIsrael will split off from Jerusalem and Judah and go to war with\\nthem.\\n\\n       [Zc 12.7-10]  And YHVH will give victory to Judah...\\n       And on that day, I will seek to destroy the nations\\n       that come against Jerusalem (in Judah).  And I will\\n       pour a spirit of compassion and supplication... on\\n       Jerusalem so that when they look on him who they have\\n       pierced, they will mourn, and weep bitterly over him\\n       like you weep over a firstborn child.\\n\\nJohn\\'s attempt to make up prophecy is perhaps weaker that\\nMatthew\\'s attempts.  Matthew, at least, usually excontexts more\\nthan just one passage.  John\\'s errors are grossly obvious and\\nblatant here.  It does not speak well for any of the gospel\\nwriters, as it helps to show how the prophetic aspects of their\\nreligion were founded.\\n\\n\\x0c\\nReckoned with\\nTransgressors:\\n\\n       After his arrest, Jesus is quickly executed for claiming\\nthe Jewish kingship, messiahship.   According to one version of\\nthe gospel tale, Jesus gets executed along with two thieves.\\n\\n       [Mk 15.27]  And with him they crucified two robbers,\\n       one on his right, one on his left.  And so the\\n       scripture was fulfilled which says,\\n\\n       \"He was reckoned with the transgressors.\"\\n\\nHere, Mark is trying to link Jesus to a passage in Isaiah 53,\\nabout the servant nation of Israel.  The passage is not about the\\nmessiah, for if one reads the whole chapter of Isaiah 53, and its\\nsurrounding chapters, one sees that the servant is a nation.  The\\nverses are also about what this servant has gone through in the\\npast, not a prediction of what is to come, in any event.  The\\nservant is thought of as a criminal.  This also happens to fit the\\ndescription of Jesus.  Had the passage really been about the\\nmessiah, it still is not at all clear why executing Jesus between\\ntwo thieves would fulfill the \"prophecy\" in Isaiah.  Jesus would\\nmore fittingly fulfill it with his whole ministry.  He was\\nconsidered a blasphemer and troublemaker all throughout his\\ncareer.   Locking onto a single event is a rather poor way to\\nsteal prophecy, at least in this case, as we see that Mark could\\nhave had made a better analogy with general comparisons.\\n\\n       Mark goes on to tell us how \"those who were crucified with\\n[Jesus] also reviled him.\" [15.32]  This is to be expected from a\\ncouple of robbers.  Of course in his later recount, St. Luke\\ndecides to change some things.  Luke tells us,\\n\\n       [Lk 23.39-43]  And one of the criminals who was hanged\\n       with him railed, \"Aren\\'t you the messiah?! Save\\n       yourself, and us!\"\\n\\nThis certainly fits with Mark\\'s recount, which tells how the\\npeople who crucified Jesus said, \"Save yourself!\" and that the\\nrobbers did the same.  But then Luke goes on,\\n\\n       But the other [criminal] rebuked [the first] saying,\\n       \"Don\\'t you fear G\\'d, since you are under the same\\n       sentence of condemnation?  And we, indeed justly so,\\n       for we are receiving the due reward for our deeds. \\n       But, this man has done nothing wrong. And he said,\\n       \"Jesus, remember me when you come in your kingdom.\" \\n       And Jesus answered, \"Verily I say to you, today you\\n       will be with me in paradise.\"\\n\\nNow, this little dialogue seems highly contrived.  It stretches\\nthe imagination a bit to see this picture of one ruffian rebuking\\nhis fellow criminal with such eloquent speech.  We have a rather\\nstrange picture of a criminal lamenting over the goodness of his\\npunishment and the justness of his suffering.   Such a man,\\napparently noble and of principle, doesn\\'t seem likely to have\\nbeen a robber.  We wonder at the amount of theatrics created by\\nLuke.  Of course, Luke\\'s recount also disagrees with Mark\\'s.  \\nLuke has only one criminal revile Jesus, not both.  It is easy\\nenough to discount the discrepancy because the account was made\\nup, but those who wish to believe it is all part of the error free\\nwords of G\\'d do not have this avenue open.  This is yet another\\nexample of a writer trying to take an Old Testament passage and\\nexpand it and reinterpret it to suit his theology.  In this case,\\nthe embroidery creates some embarrassing problems, as we have\\nseen.\\n\\nThe End of the\\nWorld--\\n       Mt. 24:\\n\\n       Now comes perhaps one of the most extraordinary and\\nembarrassing passages in the New Testament.  It is found in all\\nthree of the synoptic gospel stories, and casts some of the most\\nunfavourable doubt on the whole theory of Christianity.  Jesus\\nmentions the destruction of the Jewish temples and buildings, and\\nhis disciples ask him about this, and about the end of the world\\nwhich he has been warning about.\\n\\n       The disciples: Tell us, when will this [the temple\\'s\\n       destruction] be, and what will be the sign of your\\n       coming, and of the close of the age?\\n\\n       Jesus: Take care that no one leads you astray, for\\n       many will come in my name, saying, \"I am the christ.\"  \\n       ...you will hear of wars and rumours of wars... for\\n       this must take place, but the end is not yet.   For,\\n       nation will rise against nation... all this is but the\\n       beginning of the birthpangs.\\n             They will deliver you up... put you to death,\\n       and false prophets will arise and lead many astray.\\n       ...But he who endures to the end will be saved.  This\\n       gospel will be preached throughout the whole world, a\\n       testimony to the nations, and then the end will come.\\n             So, when you see the desolation spoken of by the\\n       prophet Daniel, ...let those who are in Judea flee to\\n       the mountains.\\n\\n             Immediately after the tribulation of those days,\\n       the sun will be darkened... the stars will fall from\\n       heaven... then will appear the sign of the Son of Man\\n       in heaven, and all the tribes of the earth will mourn,\\n       and see the Son of Man coming... and he will send out\\n       his angels... and gather his elect...\\n             Learn the lesson of the fig tree: as soon as its\\n       branch becomes tender and puts forth leaves, you know\\n       that summer is near.  So also, when you see all these\\n       things, you will know that He is near, at the very\\n       gate.  Truly I say to you, this generation will not\\n       pass away until all these things take place...\\n             But, of the day and hour, no one knows; not the\\n       angels, not the Son, but only the Father... Therefore,\\n       you also must be ready, for the Son of Man is coming\\n       at an hour you do not expect.\\n\\nFrom this, it is clear that Jesus thought the world would in\\nwithin the lifetimes of at least some of his disciples.  He tells\\nthem that although he doesn\\'t know the exact day or hour, that it\\nwill come, and thus they must be ready.  Theologians have wet\\ntheir pants in panic to find some way out of this Holy Error. \\nBut, unfortunately, Jesus made himself to explicit.  He told his\\ndisciples that their generation would still be around at the End,\\nand that they in particular should prepare for it, prepare to be\\nswept away.\\n      There have been some who resorted to removing the inerrant\\nnature of the Bible, and said that the phrase, \"this generation\\nshall not pass away...\" really means \"this race of people will not\\npass away...\"  Of course, the word for generation is used many\\ntimes to refer to exactly that, the generation of the disciples. \\nIt is an interesting notion that when God decided to learn Greek,\\nhe didn\\'t learn it well enough to make himself clear.  But. it is\\nquite obvious from the rest of the dialogue that the disciples (at\\nleast some of them) are supposed to live to the End of the World. \\nThe charge of mistranslation is completely blown away by looking\\nat the Apostles\\' responses.  It becomes abundantly clear from\\nRev. 22.7, 1 Peter 4.7, 1 John 2.18, and Rev. 22.20, that Jesus\\nmeant exactly what he said.  The End was very near.\\n\\n       For 2,000 years, Christians have rationalised this 24th\\nchapter of Matthew, or ignored its meaning altogether.  For 2,000\\nyears, they have waited for their executed leader to come back,\\nhearing of wars, and rumours of wars, sure that He is coming soon. \\nSurely He must be.  All we must do is wait.  Can you imagine how\\ntired He must be, sitting around up there, being holy, waiting for\\njust the right moment to spring?\\n\\n\\n       So, shortly after his crucifixion, Jesus of Nazareth,\\n(Joshua-ben-Joseph), died.   It is said that after three days, or\\nthree days and three nights, or three periods of time, or three\\neternal seconds --or three of whatever they can decide makes for\\nless trouble-- he was seen again, resurrected, glowing with divine\\nradiance.  Then the Saviour decided it wasn\\'t in the best\\ninterests of his new religion to stick around, and therefore\\ndisappeared from sight into heaven.  So the story goes, anyway. \\nAs has been seen, there were many things attributed to Jesus when\\npeople got around to writing the gospel stories down.  To them,\\nJesus was the fulfiller of all prophecy and scripture.  We have\\nseen, though, that this matter is quite shaky.  But, throughout\\nChurch history, Christians have held fast to faith, in simple\\nbelief.  What doctrinal objections could not be solved with\\nargumentation or brute force, faith and forgetfulness kept away\\nfrom question.  To question and investigate has never been the\\neasiest way to treat matters.  Thus for 2,000 years, the\\nprophecies cited in the New Testament have gone on largely\\naccepted.  Things may well continue that way for some time. \\nPausing a moment to consider the way the doctrines of Christianity\\nhave been accepted and used (properly or improperly) to support\\nwars and persecution, I suppose there is one prophecy of which\\nChristianity can securely keep hold.\\n\\n       [Mt 10.34]  Jesus: \"Don\\'t think that I have come to\\n       bring peace on earth.  I haven\\'t come to bring peace,\\n       but rather a sword.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

Only a very small percentage of microlife is\\nharmful to humans... and that small percentage seems to be reasonalby\\nconstant in size, but the ranks keep changing. For example, bubonic\\nplague used to be a really nasty disease, I\\'m sure you\\'ll agree. But\\nit still pops up from time to time, even today... and doesn\\'t do as\\nmuch damage. Part of that is because of better sanitation, but even\\nwhen people get the disease, the symptoms tend to be less severe than in\\nthe past.

I have a question. Humans were created perfect, right?\\nAnd, you admit that we have an inbuilt abiliy to fight off disease. It\\nseems unlikely that Satan, who\\'s making the diseases, would also gift\\nhumans with the means to fight them off. Simpler to make the diseases less\\nlethal, if he wants survivors. As far as I can see, our immune systems,\\nimperfect though they may (presently?) be, must have been built into us\\nby God. I want to be clear on this: are you saying that God was planning\\nahead for the time when Satan would be in charge by building an immune\\nsystem that was not, at the time of design, necessary? That is, God made\\nour immune systems ahead of time, knowing that Adam and Eve would sin and\\ntheir descendents would need to fight off diseases?\\n\\n>This may be more of a mystical/supernatural explanation than you\\n>are prepared to accept, but God is not responsible for disease.\\n>Even if Satan had nothing to do with the original inception of\\n>disease, evolution by random chance would have produced them since\\n>humanity forsook God\\'s protection.\\n\\n Here\\'s another puzzle.

Laughs & serious questions about real religion.\\nKeywords: Eveism, religion, \\nNntp-Posting-Host: rs6101.ecs.rpi.edu\\nOrganization: Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy NY\\nLines: 102\\n\\nLet me begin by saying I think this is the world\\'s first religion to use\\nthe net as its major recruitment medium.  Therefore, even if this\\nreligion does not take off, its founding members will be very important\\nhistorically as this method of soliciting membership will eventually become \\ncommon.\\n\\nThe basis of this religion is to apply various aspects of current conventional\\nmorality to the characters in Genesis and Exodus but assume that the Bible\\'s\\naccounts of the facts and historical events is correct.\\n\\nFor example,\\n\\nStory of Adam and Eve:\\nAdam and Eve are in Garden of Eden naked and ignorant.  Have unlimited\\nsupply of food provided, but no clothing, jobs, or knowledge.  God says\\nnot to eat fruit of tree of knowledge.  They do anyway, then try to hide \\nin bushes.  God finds them and forces them out of Garden.\\n(There are several different stories on what they were doing while naked in\\nthe bushes that might have angered God.)\\n\\nTraditional Philosophy:\\n1. The only reason you need knowledge or a job is to eat.  If someone else will\\nprovide you with food, then you can be stupid and unemployed and it\\'s OK. This\\nis why married women usually didn\\'t work until recent decades.\\n2. Authority figures, such as God, whoever was behind the Vietnam War, Hitler \\nand slaveowners, are always right and should be blindly followed without \\nquestion by ordinary people, who can\\'t make decisions for themselves.\\n\\nInterpretation of events based on Traditional Philosophy:\\nThey were not supposed to eat the fruit.  They should have done whatever God\\ntold them to.  Like small children, they had their needs provided for and were\\nobligated to do whatever their \"Father\" said to.  Being forced to leave the \\nGarden and work in order to obtain food was a punishment.\\n\\nLessons from Traditional Interpretation:\\n1.  Ignorance is good.  Knowledge is bad, but tempting.\\n2.  Having food provided for you for nothing (read \"welfare\") is ideal.  Get-\\nting a job and feeding yourself with what you earn is punishment.\\n3.  Public nudity is good.  Covering up is bad.\\n4.  Authority figures are intrinsically right.  Normal people are dumb and \\nshould do whatever they are told without question.  They should not think for \\nthemselves.\\n5.  People in subordinate positions are especially obligated to refrain from\\nlearning.  For example, it should be illegal for slaves to learn to read.\\n\\n1990\\'s philosophy:\\n1.  People should seek education and employment outside the home, unless\\nnamed \"Hillary Clinton\" or \"Murphy Brown\".\\n2.  People should use common sense.  They should not kill other people \\n(binding of Issac, wars, Holocaust, etc.) just because they are told to.\\n\\nInterpretation of events based on current philosophy:\\nThey were supposed to eat the fruit.  God gave wanted them to seek knowledge\\nrather than be handed it on a silver platter.  Once they had gained knowledge\\nand (by seeking it) showed their ability to make mature decisions for them-\\nselves, they no longer needed to be treated like little children and were \\nREWARDED by being allowed into the \"real world.\"\\n\\nLessons from new interpretation:\\n1.  Ignorance is bad.  Knowledge is good, but must be sought.\\n2.  Having food provided for you for nothing (read \"welfare\") is at best\\na temporary measure.  Getting a job and feeding yourself with what you earn\\nis ideal.\\n3.  Public nudity is bad.  Covering up is good.\\n4.  Authority figures are often wrong.  Normal people are intelligent and\\nshould consider whether the instructions are really a good idea and \"alter\\nor abolish\" bad governments.  They should think for themselves.\\n5.  People in subordinate decisions are often discouraged from knowledge\\nbut should seek it anyway, and all the harder.  For example, poor children \\nwithout good schools should work especially hard in order to make a better\\nlife for their children (and themselves).\\n\\nI have tentatively named this new philosophy \"The Church of Eveism\" because\\nEve\\'s decision to eat the apple is man[sic]kind\\'s first good decision, instead\\nof its first bad one, as traditionally believed.  She is therefore clearly\\na protagonist.  God at first appears evil, for telling people not to seek \\nknowledge but on deeper analysis is also a protagonist.  As God rewarded the\\ndecision to defy him, and provided the tree in the first place, the intention\\nand desire were clearly to have the knowledge be obtained, but to delay it \\nuntil it was actively sought.\\n\\n---End serious discussion.

Humans are not omnipotent, and neither is science.\\nHowever, science has one advantage theology doesn\\'t: it is self-\\ncorrecting, with nature as its judge. \\n\\nIt is delightful to see how scientific inquiry is revealing a self-\\nconsistent, simple picture of our universe.

There is nothing requiring that life evolve or that it\\n: acquire intelligence, it\\'s just a happy accident.\\n\\nMaybe. Who are we to tell? It seems intelligence is useful - when\\nduring the history of Earth has _one species_ been able to control\\none third of the whole biosphere? This can still be a result of \\nnumerous happy accidents our genetic machinery blindly replicates\\nand preserves.

(Recommended reading: t.o)\\n\\n: For an atheist, no\\n: event can be preferred to another or be said to have more or less\\n: value than another in any naturalistic sense, and no thought -about-\\n: an event can have value. \\n\\nFrom whose perspective? I value events and things subjectively, from\\nmy perspective. Nature does not have values, because it does not have\\na perspective - values arise from awareness. If I have a subjective\\nperspective, it is easy to assume that other people also do, and if\\nI think about what it would it be like in their position, I will\\neventually discover the Golden Rule. Morality is not necessarily\\na gift from heavens, in fact, it may be a product of evolution.\\nPerhaps we are aware of ourselves because a sense of identity\\nis helpful, allows us to play the roles of others and make us respect\\nothers who seem to have identity, too. \\n\\nBill, have you ever read Aristotle? Try his Ethica Nikomakhea (sp.)\\nfor starters.\\n\\n: How then can an atheist judge value? What is the basis for criticizing\\n: the values ennumerated in the Bible or the purposes imputed to God? On\\n: what grounds can the the behavior of the reliogious be condemned? It\\n: seems that, in judging the values that motivate others to action, you\\n: have to have some standard against which conduct is measured, but what\\n: in nature can serve that purpose? What law of nature can you invoke to\\n: establish your values.\\n\\nC.S. Lewis tells us that this argument was the main reason why\\nhe abandoned his atheism and became Christian. The argument is\\nseverely flawed.\\n\\nSome values, such as the Golden Rule, can have a rational basis. Some\\nothers, like the basic idea of wanting to live, has probably its\\nroots in the way our brains are wired. Lewis ignored the very real\\npossiblity that natural selection could also favour altruistic\\nbehaviour, and morality as well. Indeed, as humans evolved better\\nand better in building and using tools, they also became better\\nat killing each other. It is a logical necessity that evolution could\\nonly favour those who knew how to use tools, but not against one\\'s\\nown people.\\n\\nThe Bible reveals quite nicely that the morality of the early Jews\\nwas not beyond this. A simple set of rules to hold the people\\ntogether, under one god. Their god did not care much about people\\nof other nations. \\n\\nAt the time of the NT, things were quite different - the Jews\\nwere under rule of an _empire_, and could no longer simply ignore\\nthe Gentiles. A new situation required a new morality, and along\\nwith it a new religion was born. (A mutation in a meme pool.)\\n\\n: Since every event is entirely and exclusively a physical event, what\\n: difference could it possibly make what -anyone- does, religious or\\n: otherwise, there can be no -meaning- or gradation of value. The only\\n: way an atheist can object to -any- behaviour is to admit that the\\n: objection is entirely subjective and that he(she) just doesn\\'t like it\\n: - that\\'s it. Any value judgement must be prefaced by the disclaimer\\n: that it is nothing more than a matter of personal opinion and carries\\n: no weight in any \"absolute\" sense.\\n\\nIt looks like you haven\\'t bothered to read philosophy. Whenever there\\nis an observer, there is a subjective point of view, which may \\nvalue its existence and happiness (even if that were just a result\\nof some physical event), and other\\'s happiness, too, if the observer\\ncomes to think about it. In an absolutely objective sense, that is,\\nwithout any observers or subjects, moral judgments lose their\\nmeaning. \\n\\nIt is not possible for a value to simply exist without a point of\\nview. This includes gods, too, their values are only _their_ \\npersonal judgments, not absolute truths, since such truths\\ndo not exist. \\n\\nThe fact that most people do not deliberately want to hurt others\\nis a manifestation of the way we have fought for our existence\\nby becoming social beings who can think and value others\\'\\nexistence.\\n\\nMorality is not property of humans alone - chimps, dolphins and\\nmany other species show great care for each other. Dolphins have\\nsometimes saved humans from drowning, a good deed indeed. \\n\\n: That you don\\'t like what God told people to do says nothing about God\\n: or God\\'s commands, it says only that there was an electrical event in your\\n: nervous system that created an emotional state that your mind coupled\\n: with a pre-existing thought-set to form that reaction. That your\\n: objections -seem- well founded is due to the way you\\'ve been\\n: conditioned; there is no \"truth\" content. The whole of your\\n: intellectual landscape is an illusion, a virtual reality.\\n\\nThe last statement does not logically follow. In fact, there is\\nevery reason to believe our thoughts can model reality very\\nwell, and our senses can convey reliable information. Solipsism\\nis still a logical possibility, but not a very likely one.\\n\\nYou are continuously mixing two different views: the subjective\\npoint of view (which we all share) and an objective point of view,\\n_which does not exist_. Any observer or thinker, any personal being,\\nhas its own point of view. It does not matter whether this point\\nof view is a result of some physical events or not, it does not\\ncease to be subjective. \\n\\nFrom a non-observers non-point of view, values do not exist. Neither\\ndoes pain, or pleasure, or beauty, or love. Such things are \\ninherently subjective. \\n\\nOnce again, if god wants wives to submit to their husbands, or even\\nto make a leap of faith into the unknown, or wants to punish us if\\nwe don\\'t, I disagree with his morals. I do not think my morals come\\nfrom any supreme being - to remove my morals means the same than\\nto make me a zombie, a machine without a single thought. If god\\ngave us morality to judge, but I disagree with him, it is not my\\nfault. He is free to replace my morals. I cannot see what is the\\npoint of giving someone a moral system which disagrees with one\\'s\\nown and then to get mad at this. \\n\\nGod must be schizophrenic.\\n\\n: All of this being so, you have excluded\\n: yourself from any discussion of values, right, wrong, goood, evil,\\n: etc. and cannot participate. Your opinion about the Bible can have no\\n: weight whatsoever.\\n\\nNeither can the opinion of any god, for that matter. I cannot understand\\nwhy a subjective opinion of a thing made of matter is in any way\\nless credible than an opinion of a thing made of something else.\\n\\nBill, take note: Absolute values must be independent of _any_ being,\\n_including_ gods.

On the other hand he has\\npresented no use of:\\n \\n(d) historical context                or\\n(e) historical content                or\\n(f) other pertinent historical info   or\\n(g) cultural context                  or\\n(h) cultural content                  or\\n(i) other pertinent cultural info     or\\n(j) grammatical construction          or even\\n(k) Hebrew and Greek word studies [remember, Archer and Bullinger don\\'t count]\\n \\nThus we find his vaunted criteria for exegisis is just empty mouthings.\"\\n \\nMY REPLY...\\nQuestion:  Do you find such criteria important?  If so, do you plan on starting\\nto use them to the best of your ability, or will you continue to present\\nshallow observations (I don\\'t mean this in a bad way).\\nAt this point in our _debates_, I have not found it necessary to present a\\ntotal exegetical analysis of these passages, since we seem to keep beating\\naround the bush and not getting into the core of the verses.  I do not believe\\nit necessary to use many of the above criteria to refute your arguments re:\\nJudas in Acts and Matthew, but I will do my best from this point on to use\\nseveral of the above criteria, since you desire me to.  I hope you will also.\\nIt will greatly enhance our study of these passages.\\n \\nDB...\\n\"The only thing he has actually used, beyond the passage itself, is any other\\npassage.

You claim that the\\nPASSAGES contradict one another; I do not see the PASSAGES contradicting one\\nanother.\\n(1) They may very well be complimentary, as many scholarly sources mention;\\n(2) Matthew may not be presenting Judas\\' death, as you claim.  But we\\'ll look\\nat your defense of this later.\\n \\nAlso, the \"reward of iniquity\" in the Acts PASSAGE may not be the 30 pieces of\\nsilver in Matthew\\'s PASSAGES.  (Although you have a valiant attempt later at\\nstating why you believe it is).\\n \\nAt this beginning stages in our debates, we are laying some Scriptural\\ngroundwork, which will be expanded upon through deeper exegesis.\\n \\nDB...\\n\"Of course the only reason I can see to so drastically reinterpret a passage\\nas he has done with Judas\\' death, is to make it agree with another passage so\\nthat both could be considered correct.\"\\n \\nMY REPLY...\\nOne of the reasons I have given a different exegetical view of the passages is\\nthat you seem to think the majority of scholarship is wrong in concluding these\\npassages are complimentary.  However, I see no problem in Tony Rose\\'s\\nexplanation of Judas\\' death...\\n \\n_____________________________________________________________________\\n \\nHOW WOULD YOU EXPLAIN THE INACCURACY BETWEEN JUDAS HANGING\\nHIMSELF IN MATTHEW 27:5 AND \"FALLING HEADLONG HE BURST OPEN\"\\n=============================================================\\n \\nThis question of the manner in which Judas died is one with which we are\\nconstantly confronted in our travels. Many people point to the apparent\\ndiscrepancy in the two accounts as an obvious, irreconcilable error.\\nSome have gone so far as to say that the idea of an inerrant Bible is\\ndestroyed by these contradictory accounts. However, this is not the case at\\nall.\\nMatthew relates that Judas hanged himself, while Peter tells us he fell and\\nwas crushed by the impact. The two statements are indeed different, but do\\nthey necessarily contradict each other?\\nMatthew does not say that Judas did not fall; neither does Peter say that\\nJudas did not hang himself. This is not a matter of one person calling\\nsomething black and the other person calling it white. Both accounts can be\\ntrue and supplementary.\\nA possible reconstruction would be this: Judas hanged himself on a tree on the\\nedge of a precipice that overlooked the valley of Hinnom. After he hung there\\nfor some time, the limb of the tree snapped or the rope gave way and Judas\\nfell down the ledge, mangling his body in the process.\\nThe fall could have been before *or* after death as either would fit this\\nexplanation. This possibility is entirely natural when the terrain of the\\nvalley of Hinnom is examined.  From the bottom of the valley, you can see\\nrocky terraces 25 to 40 feet in height and almost perpendicular.\\nThere are still trees around the ledges and a rocky pavement at the bottom.\\nTherefore, it is easy to conclude that Judas struck one of the jagged rocks on\\nthis way down, tearing his body open. It is important to remember that we are\\nnot told how long Judas remained hanging from the tree or how advanced\\nwas the decomposition of his body before his fall.\\nLouis Gaussen relates a story of a man who was determined to kill himself.\\nThis individual placed himself on the sill of a high window and pointed a\\npistol at his head. He then pulled the trigger and leaped from the window at\\nthe same time.\\nOn the other hand, a person could say that this man took his life by shooting\\nhimself, while another could rightly contend he committed suicide by jumping\\nform the tall building. In this case, both are true, as both are true in the\\ncase of Matthew\\'s and Peter\\'s accounts of the death of Judas. It is merely a\\nsituation of different perspectives of the same event.\\n \\n_____________________________________________________________________\\n \\nYour only reason for rejecting this is, I believe, your attempt to discredit\\ninerrancy.  You haven\\'t related how this is IMPOSSIBLE or highly unlikely.\\nHere\\'s what you said in an earlier post...\\n \\n_____________________________________________________________________\\nDB [quoting Tony Rose]...\\n> There are still trees around the ledges and a rocky pavement at the bottom.\\n> Therefore, it is easy to conclude that Judas struck one of the jagged rocks\\n> on this way down, tearing his body open.

But you haven\\'t addressed why you feel that way.  You can say\\nit\\'s a vain attempt to reconcile the contradiction, but that doesn\\'t tell me it\\ndidn\\'t happen, nor have you shown why you reject that possibility.\\n \\nQuestions:  Is Matthew lying or is Luke lying?  Or are they both lying?  Or\\nare either or both of them misinformed?  Why do you think there is such an\\nalleged contradiction?  I do not think you have ever told us what you believe\\nin this respect.\\n \\nDB...\\n\"At present though, Mr DeCenso only asks two questions of me:\\n \\n> (1) You claim Acts and Matthew contradict one another in representing Judas\\'\\n>     death.  I ask you again to provide evidence that Matthew stated Judas\\n>     died in the hanging.\\n> (2) You claim that the 30 pieces of silver in Matthew that Judas threw down\\n>     in the temple and the chief priests used, is the \"reward of iniquity\"\\n>     in Acts that pictures Judas in some way purchasing a field with;\\n>     therefore there is a contradiction.  Prove that the 30 pieces of silver\\n>     and the \"reward of iniquity\" are one and the same.\\n \\nActually I find question (1) to be a rather stupid request, but I will answer\\nit because he now restricts himself to two points.  First I would point out\\nthat hanging is a very efficient manner for ending a life.  In fact it is a\\nbit of a fluke when someone survives hanging (except in fantasy cowboy\\nmovies), and even then it usually referred to as an attempted hanging.\"\\n \\nMY REPLY...\\nI work at an agency that investigates child abuse and neglect.  Today, I got a\\ncall re: a child that attempted suicide by hanging himself because his mother\\nis on crack.  He failed in his attempt and is in a child\\'s psych ward at a\\nlocal hospital.  Hanging attempts are not always successful.\\n \\nTo assume that because most hangings are successful, this one was also is\\n\"begging the question\", if I may quote you.\\n \\n[Last night, listening to _The Bible Answer Man_ broadcast, The Christian\\nResearch Institute\\'s show, one of the scholars on there used several of these\\nterms that you use.  I am not all that familiar with them.  The man on the BAM\\nshow teaches Comparative Religion and Logic.  It was interesting]\\n \\nDB...\\n\"This is so prevalent that, so that to say a man hung himself with no other\\nqualifiers is synonymous with stating that he killed himself.\"\\n \\nMY REPLY...\\nQualifiers are important at times, as we\\'ll see in an OT passage I\\'ll mention\\nbelow.\\nDoes hanging ALWAYS have this outcome?  Did Matthew, who is the only source we\\nhave re: Judas hanging himself, state that Judas died as a result?  To say it\\'s\\nsynonymous means it has the same meaning as.

If so, should we do, as we have done\\nwith Archer, toss them to the side and not value anything they say, including\\ntheir \"interpretation\" of the hanging of Judas?  I am sure _you_ would find\\nsome errors and maybe even some deception in those sources.\\n \\nYou also noted they \"interpreted\" the hanging as meaning he died.

All it says is that he \"went and hanged himself.\" Luke however, in\\nActs, tells us that \"and falling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all\\nhis entrails gushed out.\" This is a pretty clear indication (along with the\\nother details given in Acts - Peter\\'s speech, the need to pick a new apostle,\\netc.) that at least after Judas\\' fall, he was dead.

Although it\\'s possible and plausible that he fell from the hanging\\nand hit some rocks, thereby bursting open, I can no longer assume that to be\\nthe case.  Therefore, no contradiction.

One\\nsimply ignored it entirely and simply referred back to Matthew\\'s version as\\nthe correct version in both Matt and Acts.  \"The Biblical Knowledge Commentary\"\\nsuggested the hypotheses that Judas hung and then when he rotted, his belly\\nexploded (which doesn\\'t explain his headlong fall), or that his branch or rope\\nbroke, and he fell to his death and his gut gushed out (which doesn\\'t explain\\nhow a hanging man, would fall headlong rather than feet first).\"\\n \\nMY REPLY...\\nThe outcome of any fall is dependent upon many factors...how high the person\\nwas suspended before the fall, any obstructions such as tree branches that may\\nhave deviated the fall, how steep an incline of rocky surfaces the victim fell\\nupon, thus possibly rolling or bouncing of several rocks, etc.  In a\\nsuperficial examination of the Acts passage and the Matthew passage, we are not\\ngiven a lot of info on the geographical specifics, but Tony in the above quoted\\npost gave us some...\\n \\n_____________________________________________________________________\\nA possible reconstruction would be this: Judas hanged himself on a tree on the\\nedge of a precipice that overlooked the valley of Hinnom.

Why don\\'t I and the (myriads of) other Christians like me\\n> tell you something about Christianity? ...\\n\\nIn a sense, the wide variety of interpretations does tell us\\nsomething about Christianity.  It tells us that the New Testament\\nauthors left a sufficiently vague hodge-podge that it can serve\\nas the source text for many, vastly different beliefs about the\\nnature of the Christian god and about what men should and\\nshouldn\\'t do. \\n\\nThe irony here is that there is *nothing* in Christianity per\\nse that Michael can use to support the cause of lesbians and\\ngays.  *Every* Christian principle he turns to this cause is\\neffective only through the extra-Christian principles through\\nwhich Michael interprets his religion, and the homophobes apply\\nthe *same* Christian principles, with equal justification, to\\ntheir cause.  In short, it is the extra-Christian principles that\\nmake Michael\\'s Christianity beneficial, and I suspect they would\\nbe as beneficial, perhaps moreso, without being filtered by\\nChristian interpretation.  \\n\\nMichael paints a picture of \"standard American atheism\" as the\\nrejection of the evil in many conservative Christian\\ninterpretations of the Bible.  But I think it is even more\\ndamaging to Christianity to note that the New Testament presents\\nsuch a vague hodge-podge of notions about the nature of God and\\nthe nature of the good (except, of course, when it is ordered by\\nan interpretation that relies on extraneous principles).  Here, I\\nthink we should apply a Christian parable, where a cold drink can\\nhave its value and a hot drink can have its value, but the\\nlukewarm we should spit out. \\n\\nRussell\\n',\n",

The story of Adam and Eve is a picture\\nof the archetypal humans before obtaining moral consciousness. Theirs\\nwas a harmonious relationship with each other, the world, and the\\nCreator. That innocent harmony was shattered when they disobeyed God,\\ntheir natural wholeness falling apart into two seemingly\\nirreconcilable halves. Immediately, guilt and fear was manifested in\\ntheir lives. They become bound to hardship, toil, and suffering.  This\\nis symbolized in their exile from the paradisiac state.\\n\\nThe beast in the jungle does not possess moral consciousness.

Does this make all homosexuals bad if this is\\ntrue? Of course not. And what about bisexuals? Are they half-Nazis?\\n\\nI don\\'t know why it would be so difficult to believe that some Nazis were\\nhomosexuals. The German officer corps before WW1, for instance, was notorious\\nfor its homosexuality. There were numerous scandals which rocked the German\\ngovt. during the late 19th and early 20th century. Many of the Kaiser\\'s friends\\nwere prosecuted - the Kaiser was no homosexual, but the Germany army had a long\\ntradition of tolerating homosexuality, going far back into Prussian history -\\nback to Frederick the Great at least, who was himself a homosexual. Roehm was a \\nproduct of this Prussian officer tradition, and the old German army (like the\\nEnglish public school system), being a well known center of homosexuality,\\nwould have been quite willing to overlook Roehm\\'s homosexuality.\\n\\nIn addition, some Nazis complained of homosexuality in the Hitler Youth. The\\nHitler Youth swallowed up all pre-Nazi youth groups, and some of the various \\npre-war Vandervogel, Bund, and Volkish youth groups were known to promote \\nhomoerotic ideals and friendship, and in many cases, homosexuality itself. So \\nit seems to me not unlikely that there were plenty of homosexual Nazis, \\nregardless of the official Nazi dogmas concerning the \"evils\" of homosexuality.\\nWhy should this suprise anyone?

Nor do I intend to reread every book on the Nazis and on modern\\nhomosexuality that I have ever read - I don\\'t have the time. Nothing is\\nstopping you, however, from chasing down those sources.

The majority doesn\\'t care - it believes,\\nbut doesn\\'t know what or how. \\n\\nPeople don\\'t usually allow their beliefs to change their lifestyle,\\nthey only want to keep the virtual gate open. A Christian would say\\nthat they are not \"born in the Spirit\", but this does not disturb them.\\nReligion is not something to think about. \\n\\nI\\'m afraid a society with a true atheist majority is an impossible\\ndream. Religions have a strong appeal to people, nevertheless - \\na promise of life after death is something humans eagerly listen to.\\nCoupled with threats of eternal torture and the idea that our\\nmorality is under constant scrutiny of some cosmic cop, too many\\npeople take the poison with a smile. Or just pretend to swallow\\n(and unconsciously hope god wouldn\\'t notice ;-) )\\n\\n: Also, how many atheists out there would actually take the stance and accor a\\n: higher value to their way of thinking over the theistic way of thinking.  The\\n: typical selfish argument would be that both lines of thinking evolved from the\\n: same inherent motivation, so one is not, intrinsically, different from the\\n: other, qualitatively.  But then again a measuring stick must be drawn\\n: somewhere, and if we cannot assign value to a system of beliefs at its core,\\n: than the only other alternative is to apply it to its periphery; ie, how it\\n: expresses its own selfishness.\\n\\nIf logic and reason are valued, then I would claim that atheistic thinking\\nis of higher value than the theistic exposition. Theists make unnecessary\\nassumptions they believe in - I\\'ve yet to see good reasons to believe\\nin gods, or to take a leap of faith at all. A revelation would do.\\n\\nHowever, why do we value logic and reasoning? This questions bears\\nsome resemblance to a long-disputed problem in science: why mathematics\\nworks?

Critz, III (CIS ID# 71611,365), of Peoria, Illinois.\\nEnviroLeague exists for the education of youth, both male and female, in\\nmatters concerning their values related to and responsibility for our\\nenvironment.\\n \\nIncorporated as an Illinois not-for-profit corporation, its Articles and\\ninitial applications for a service mark have now been filed.  According to\\nCritz, its draft Bylaws contain the following statement of Mission and\\nObjectives:\\n \\n                           MISSION\\n \\n   It is the Mission of EnviroLeague and its adult members\\n   to foster and implement the improved education of young\\n   people in the need to conduct their lives as Stewards\\n   of The Earth, to leave The Earth in a better condition\\n   than they found it, and to otherwise act as responsible,\\n   moral and ethical users of their environment.  To pursue\\n   the accomplishment of this Mission, EnviroLeague shall\\n   seek to serve as a catalyst, focusing in common cause the\\n   separate efforts of all groups desiring the preservation,\\n   improvement, and responsible use of the environment in\\n   which we must all live.\\n \\n                         OBJECTIVES\\n \\n   In pursuit of the Mission of EnviroLeague, its primary\\n   objectives shall be:\\n       (1)  To establish a Movement involving as many\\n            environmentally concerned organizations as\\n            possible, said Movement having as its primary\\n            focus the education and participatory\\n            involvement of young people in appropriate areas\\n            of environmental concern;\\n       (2)  To develop and provide to such organizations and\\n            their branches a full complement of program\\n            materials for their use, including suitable\\n            uniforms, insignia and other badges, written\\n            ideas, syllabi and information, literature and\\n            other items as shall seem appropriate and\\n            desirable;\\n       (3)  To serve as a \"clearing house\" for the exchange\\n            of program ideas, materials and information\\n            among said organizations;  and\\n       (4)  To assist environmentally concerned\\n            organizations to recruit and train the necessary\\n            adult leadership for their youth programs.\\n \\nEnviroLeague will operate through three \"Program Divisions\" serving youth in\\nthe elementary, middle and high school grades, respectively.  Service shall be\\nthrough formation of \"EnviroLeague Teams,\" either by EnviroLeague itself or by\\nenvironmentally conscious organizations (or their local branches) wishing a\\ncharter to use programs developed by EnviroLeague.\\n \\nEnviroLeague, as it develops, will be controlled by the actual adult leaders\\nof each local Team, and will have no nationally imposed obstacles to\\nmembership or adult leadership status not based upon relevant improper\\nconduct. Organizations accepting a charter may, however, impose certain\\nadditional standards for their own use of the program material.  Should such\\norganizations do so, EnviroLeague will commit itself to forming, as soon as\\npossible, new nearby Teams having no such restrictions, particularly as to\\nyouth membership.\\n \\nEnviroLeague will operate on the principle that youth will have much to\\ncontribute to developing its programs.  Thus, the top youth leaders of its\\nTeams for middle and high school youth may become involved in governing any\\nlocal administrative groups, and those for its high school youth may be\\ninvolved in similar functions at the national level.\\n \\nProgram materials are in development at this time.  Copies of the \"draft\"\\nportions of the Mentor\\'s Manual (manual for adult leadership) will be in the\\nEARTH Forum, Library 17. These files will be updated as development takes\\nplace.\\n \\nCompuServe is particularly proud that EnviroLeague\\'s founder chose this\\nelectronic medium to make the first public announcement of its formation.\\nThis announcement is being made simultaneously in both the OUTDOOR and EARTH\\nForums.\\n \\nThe electronic home of EnviroLeague is in CompuServe\\'s Earth Forum - GO\\nEARTH - message and library areas 17, both named \"EnviroLeague.\"\\n============================================================================\\n \\nSubsequently, EnviroLeague\\'s Initial Governance Council has held its first\\nmeeting.  Boyd Critz was elected as the first EnviroLeague Chief Guardian\\n(equivalent to Chairman of the Board or CEO).  He can be reached at home\\n(309) 675-4483 in case of real need.

After he and his brother Hyram\\n#were murdered in a Nauvoo, Il. jail cell, church membership split over\\n#who to follow.  Initially, Smith was considered a prophet (just like\\n#Mohammed, a rather interesting parallel considering Muslims consider\\n#Christ to be a prophet the same as Jews, I\\'m led to understand.  Make\\n#no mistake, this was no messiah we\\'re talking about in Smith).  The\\n\\nAnd neither did he claim he was.  As the church reflects the moral\\naptitude of its leaders (and especially those of Joseph Smith), I have\\nnothing but the highest respect for this inspired man, whose only \"crime\"\\nwas that he refused to deny that he had seen a vision...  Many have tried\\nto explain the \"Smith phenomenon\" away, but the bold presence of an 8.5\\nmillion member strong church stands as a witness that Joseph Smith\\'s\\ntestimony had enough resilience and power to carry on the message.\\n\\n#thought at the time was that the gift of prophecy was to be handed\\n#down father to son.  After Joseph Smith died, his son was only\\n#entering his teens.  Brigham Young and a few others claimed to have\\n#been bequeathed the gift and leadership prior to his death.  The\\n#Council of Twelve, the Church governing body, wasn\\'t of much help\\n#here, and this basic conflict is still a wedge between the sects.\\n#Brigham Young took his followers to Salt Lake.  The rest waited\\n#for Smith Jr. to grow up enough to assume leadership.  The other\\n#claimants to the leadership were soon ignored, like Mike Dukakis. ;-)\\n\\n\"The rest\" were apostates and excommunicated members of the Church,\\nwhile the great majority of the membership, the Twelve, and the various\\nauxiliary organizations, chose to accept Brigham Young as the new\\nprophet and leader of the Church.  If you knew your lds scriptures and\\ndoctrine, you would have known that Brigham Young was the FIRST in\\nline to fill the prophet Joseph Smith\\'s vacancy: he was the senior\\napostle in the Quorum, and various comments made by Joseph indicated\\nthat it was Brigham who would lead the latter-day exodus to the West.\\n\\nOther rightful \"heirs\" were either dead (Hyrum Smith) or excommunicated\\n(Oliver Cowdery), and while persecutions abounded and intensified,\\nJoseph Smith had already given orders to look for a new place, an empty\\nland beyond the boundaries of the United States (at that time).  This\\n\"Rekhabite\" principle (pseudographia) was well understood and antipated\\nby the great majority of lds faithful, and was not questioned by them.\\n\\nGranted, a couple of \"do-it-yourselfers\" stayed behind, unwilling to\\nsacrifice and to undertake the perilous journey to the unknown, but\\nthis also was necessary to separate the tares from the wheat.  The\\nchurch benefitted from this purification process: they became even\\nmore unified and willing to carry out their mission to the world.\\n\\n#        Both sects practiced the \"1-year food stockpile\" doctrine,\\n#and this being frontier and farming country most carried or at\\n#least owned weapons.  There is little evidence that they were a\\n#militaristic sect, given that they tended to move on rather than\\n#face large-scale opposition.  Brigham Young, having suffered a\\n#great deal getting to Salt Lake, seems to have been quite\\n#justified in making military training a good thing.  Remember,\\n#this was far beyond where even the US Army went, and these people\\n#had nobody to turn to save themselves.\\n#\\n#        Just a little context to put this all in perspective.\\n\\nBTW, since when is the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (one of\\nthe largest denominations in the country) a \"sect\"???  It didn\\'t \"splinter\"\\nfrom any other religion, as did say, the Southern Baptists or Methodists.\\n\\n#>So what did the Mormons get?  It seems that J.

I am\\nnot comfortable with this alleged \"cosiness\" with Mammon: I assure you\\nthat *many* among us reject this attitude categorically.  Period.  Our\\nONLY true allegiance is to our God and to the leaders which He has\\nappointed to represent Him.

Even if this were true (reliable data, please), I\\nam convinced that those officers would perform to the highest codes\\nof honor and conduct (that\\'s why they were selected for in the\\nfirst place, remember?).  Besides, one of our Articles of Faith\\nSTRONGLY states the principle of freedom of religion, and that all\\npeople are free to worship \"*how*, *where*, or *what* they may.\"\\n\\n#        If it\\'s true, there would be little affect.  LDS and RLDS\\n#philosophy is that all other religions have strayed from the true\\n#Church as set down by Jesus, but that God will judge each on his\\n#own merits.  In addition, the RLDS also contend (and the LDS may\\n#as well) that ignorance of the True Way (tm) is an excuse.  You\\n#can only be condemned if you had been tought the way and rejected\\n#it.  In short, LDS and RLDS suffer everybody from Lutherans to\\n#Buddhists, secure in the knowledge that though they are wrong they\\n#will not be penalized for ignorance.

The\\nfacts are that less Iraqis died in the Gulf War than did civilians \\nin any other war of comparable size this century!  This was due mostly\\nto the short duration coupled with precise surgical bombing techniques\\nwhich were technically possible only recently.\\n\\nThe idea that \"hundreds of thousands\" of Iraqi citizens died is\\nludicrous.  Not even \"hundreds of thousands\" of Iraqi soldiers died,\\nand they were the ones being targeted!  Or do you think that the US\\nand its allies were specifically out to kill and maim Iraqi civilians?\\nEither the smart bombs didn\\'t hit their targets (and we know they did),\\nor they were targeting civilian targets (!) which is hardly condusive to\\ndestroying Iraq\\'s military potential.  The military mission planners are\\nnot fools, they know they have to hit *military* targets to win a war.\\nHitting civilian targets does nothing but unite the people against you,\\nnot a laudable goal if one wants the people to rise up against their\\ntyrant-dictator. \\n> \\n> OK, so some innocent people died.

War is never an exact science, but\\nwith smart bombs, it\\'s becoming more exact with a smaller percentage\\nof civilian casualties.  Sometimes mistakes are made; targets are\\nmisidentified; innocents die.  That\\'s war the way it really is.\\nBut the alternative, to allow tyrannical dictators to treat the earth\\nlike it\\'s one big rummage sale, grabbing everything they can get is\\nworse.  Like Patrick Henry said some 217 years ago, \"I know not what\\ncourse others may take -- but as for me, give me liberty, or give me\\ndeath!\"  War is always the price one must be willing to pay if one\\nwishes to stay free.   \\n\\n> \\n>> The death penalty was conceived as a deterrent to crime,  but the legal\\n>> shenanigans that have been added (automatic appeals, lengthy court\\n>> battles, etc.) have relegated that purpose to a very small part of what\\n>> it should be.

I\\'m sure that appeasement would have\\nworked better than war, just like it did in WW2, eh?  I guess we\\nshouldn\\'t have fought WW2 either -- just think of all those innocent\\nGerman civilians killed in Dresden and Hamburg.  How about all the poor \\nFrench who died in the crossfire because we invaded the continent?  We \\nshould have just let Hitler take over Europe, and you\\'d be speaking\\nGerman instead of English right now.\\n\\nTyrants like Hussein *have* to be stopped.  His kind don\\'t understand\\ndiplomacy; they only understand the point of a gun.  My only regret is\\nthat Bush wimped out and didn\\'t have the military roll into Baghdad, so\\nnow Hussein is still in power and the Iraqi people\\'s sacrifice (not to\\nmention the 357 Americans who died) was for naught.  Liberating Kuwait \\nwas a good thing, but wiping Hussein off the map would\\'ve been better!\\n\\nAnd as for poor, poor Rodney King!  Did you ever stop and think *why*\\nthe jury in the first trial brought back a verdict of \"not guilty\"?\\nThose who have been foaming at the mouth for the blood of those\\npolicemen certainly have looked no further than the video tape.\\nBut the jury looked at *all* the evidence, evidence which you and I\\nhave not seen.  When one makes a judgment without the benefit of a\\ntrial where evidence can be presented on both sides, one has simply\\nlowered himself to the level of vigilante justice, a state-of-mind\\nwhich your sarcasm above seemingly spoke against, but instead tends\\nto support in the case against the policemen.  \\n\\nLaw in this country is intended to protect the rights of the accused,\\nwhether they be criminals or cops.  One is not found guilty if there is\\na reasonable doubt of one\\'s guilt, and only the jury is in a position\\nto assess the evidence and render a verdict.

I think you are misreading me, rather seriously.  Though,\\ngiven my principle that one CANNOT force one\\'s own notion of \"sin\" on\\nanother, and my unshakeable \"disestablishmentarianism\", Russel Turpin\\nand others (believers and unbelievers alike) are under no threat of my\\nlegislating my own understanding of Christian love.\\n\\n>If I take him at\\n>his word, he cannot condemn the Inquisitors, because they were\\n>also following these commandments as *they* understood them.  If\\n\\nYou misread.  I can do (and have repeatedly done) a complete bill of\\naccusation against the Inquisition by exhibiting in as thorough a form\\nas anyone might want a demonstration of the harm it has done to human\\nbeings (in the first place) and to respect for (let alone love of) \"God\"\\nin near succession.  Please go back to my quoted words above:\\n\\nThe \"possibility that always exists\" is that I (or, to revert to proper\\ntime sequence, my predecessors over the last several centuries) could\\npersuade \"Christian B\" of my case that the Inquisition *does* indeed\\nconstitute an egregious violation of the Law of Love.  I must also note\\nthat the majority of Christians HAVE been so persuaded.  By Christian\\nargumentation, as well as by secular [both Christian and non-Christian]\\nprohibitions.\\n\\nWhat Mr. Turpin alludes to is a trickier point:\\n\\n\\tA.  I demonstrate the human pain and violation of love involved\\n\\t    in the Inquisition.\\n\\n\\tB.  The Inquisitor responds that Mother Church must, however\\n\\t    painful this *seems*, \"discipline\" her children for their\\n\\t    own good -- in this case the salvation of their souls (or\\n\\t    if the tortured heretic will not recant, than by bad example\\n\\t    \"deterring\" others from the same loss-of-soul.)\\n\\n\\tA.  I point out that this \"justification\" of a failure in love\\n\\t    depends on a highly speculative construal of texts and of\\n\\t    philosophical assertions that are quite undemonstrable.\\n\\n\\tB.  Burns me at the stake.\\n\\nMy rhetoric has failed, but the point I am making is sustained.  What is\\ngoing on here has a *lot* to do with \"cultural baggage.\"  In this case,\\nthe baggage includes a (nearly universal, and absolutely secular) belief\\nthat an accused person must prove innocence and that testimony is most\\nbelievable if taken under torture.  The elimination of Inqisitorial\\npractice (in those places where it *has* been eliminated, or at least\\ngreatly reduced) has very little, if anything, to do with the discussion\\nof sin in the exchange between A and B.\\n\\nMr. Turpin is pointing out that, if I am A versus the Grand Inquisitor\\'s B,\\nthen my persuasion is not very likely to work.  I know this; and in what-\\never personal agony, I consign the issue to God and my ghostly defense\\nattorney.  So, \"one possibility\" fails in this case -- as it will fail in\\nmay others.  At the other extreme, the \"persuasion\" will succeed when it\\nproperly SHOULD not, if it entails mistaken assumptions I share with the\\nInquisitor.  And that is potentially an even more troubling case, in that\\nmany of the victims of Inquisition will have \"accepted\" that they were in\\nfact sinful (in such random cases as they may actually have been guilty\\nof charges brought against them.)\\n\\nThe point is that the \"persuasion\" breaks down when the parties do NOT\\nshare enough to agree on all the cultural baggage -- and given the main\\nthrust of the Inquisition, against \"heresy\", it is *bound* to break down\\nin precisely the \"worst\" cases.  The \"conservative\" (I don\\'t think that\\nis the right word, BTW) will take refuge in what I attribute to B above,\\nthat he is \"justified\" in causing harm because he *thinks* that works to\\na \"greater good.\"  But this is a violent and extravagant REFUSAL to follow\\nthe gospel, as if one\\'s theories about \"sin\" entitled one to cast aside\\nJesus\\' words on dealing with sinners (cf. Matthew 5:39ff).\\n\\nI am a \"radical\" Christian *only* in that I take the gospel seriously.\\n\\n>(Or, for that matter, what does it mean to love one\\'s fellow\\n>man?) And what is the \"right thing\"?  And how does one go about\\n>loving god? \\n\\nWell, the whole *point* of making these the \"base\" commandments is that\\nthey *aren\\'t* reducible to rules.  A set of rules is a moral code or a\\nlaw code or an algorithm for acting.  Such things can be very helpful\\nto individuals or societies -- but not if they are used *instead* of a\\npersonal involvement in and responsibility for one\\'s actions.  The Great\\nCommandment is, more than anything else, a call to act *as if you were\\nGod and accepting ultimate responsibility* in your every action.  A\\ndemand that I, like most, would rather *not* hear, but it keeps popping\\nup nonetheless (along with the reassurance that it is more important\\nthat I be open to trying this, than succeeding at it).  \"Conservatives\"\\nmay twist this \"act as if you were God\" to mean \"lay down rules for other\\npeople and be as nasty to them as possible if they don\\'t keep YOUR rules.\"\\nThey are so insistent (and obvious) about this that they have convinced a\\nlot of people (who rightly reject the whole concept!) that such idiocy\\nIS how God acts.  That, after all, is the standard accusation \"against\\nGod\" by the atheists here and elsewhere.  That the \"conservatives\" have\\nconfused THEIR manipulative, hoop-jumping notions of coercing other\\npeople with the Nature of God is almost the entire content of standard\\nAmerican atheism -- and I quite agree with it on this point.\\n\\n>Ethical systems are not differentiated by the nice sounding goo\\n>up front, much of which sounds pretty much the same, but by the\\n>*specific* acts, procedures, and arguments that they recommend.\\n\\nAnd different bodies of Christians have, from the beginning, urged\\n*different* \"ethical systems\" (or in some cases, none).  As a result,\\nit is bizarre to identify any one of these systems, however popular\\n(or infamous) with Christianity.  Christianity DOES NOT HAVE A TORAH.\\nIt does not have a QU\\'RAN.  Specifically Christian scripture has very\\nlittle, if anything, in the way of \"commandments\" -- so little that\\nthe \"Christians\" who desperately *want* commandments go \"mining\" for\\nthem with almost no support (and thus almost no obvious limitation :-))\\nfor their efforts.  The one, single, thing in the gospels which Jesus\\nspecifically \"gives\" as \"a commandment\" to us is \"love one another.\"\\n\\n\\t[I will be expanding on this point in a reply to Paul Hudson\\n\\t that I hope to get to in a day or so -- it is quite true that\\n\\t SOME Christians infer LOTS of commandments from the NT; I\\'ll\\n\\t point out what has to be going on in these inferences, and why\\n\\t there is a huge amount of \"cultural baggage\" involved.]\\n\\nYou are quite right that this is \"goo\" if one is looking for an ethical\\nsystem.\\n\\nBut why should anyone BE looking for an ethical system, since our\\nsociety is eager to hand us one or more no matter what we do?

In actuality it is \"chorion\", which is the last word Acts\\n> 1:18.  Unfortunately my Greek dictionary does not discuss \"chorion\" so I\\n> cannot report as to the nuances of the word.\\n\\nI abhor publishing trash (I abhor it of myself even more than I do from\\nothers, but since I do not present myself as an authority on the subject, I do\\nnot feel dishonest, though I do openly admit ignorance and incompetence in\\nthis example).  Thus I felt honor bound to do a better set of research\\nspecifically on the word.  First it should be noted that Greek grammar is not\\nas tough as I first assumed (it is not nontrivial by any means, and I still am\\nnot competent with it, but it is not as opaque as I had thought).  It turns\\nout that while the Index for the Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich \"Greek Lexicon\" renders\\neach verse in order, each word within a verse is put in greek alphabetical\\norder.  Thus while the the meaning of the verse is decipherable, the syntax is\\nfar from clear.  On the other hand, a Greek-English Intralinear Bible makes\\nthings a lot more comprehendable.  And yes, the word for field in Acts 1:18 is\\nindeed \"chorion.\" \\n\\nNow I\\'ve checked several Greek-English lexicons:\\n\\n\\t\"Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament,\" Louw and Nida\\n\\t\"Robinson\\'s Greek and English Lexicon of the New Testament\"\\n\\t\"Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament,\" Grimm\\n\\t\"Word study Concordance,\" Tynsdale\\n\\t\"A Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament and other \\n\\t early Christian Writings,\" Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich\\n\\t\"The New Analytical Greek Lexicon,\" Perschbacher\\n\\nIn each case the meaning of the word Chorion was given variously as:\\n\\n\\tA space, place, region, district, field, area, \"country place,\" \\n\\tland, farm, estate, \"a bit of tillage\", and similar meanings.\\n\\nNowhere do any of these books mention anything about \"grave.\" As some of these \\nbooks go into great detail, I would be very surprised to find that these books \\nare all inadequate and Mr Archer is the only competent scholar in Greek.  I \\nthink it more likely that Mr Archer\\'s investigations into \"contradictions\" to \\nbe once again, as your friend said it, \"lacking in substance,\" and thus Archer \\nis again shown worthless as an expert witness (By the way Mr DeCenso, I would \\nhave honorably presented my results on this matter, even if I had found them\\nto support Mr Archer\\'s contentions). \\n\\nBy the way, among these lexicons, (eg: Robinson\\'s) is the definition of\\n\"agros,\" the word used in Matthew 27 to describe the field bought.  The word\\n\"agros\" is defined as \"a field in the country.\" Chorion is specifically noted\\nas a synonym to agros.  This is significant, as it is evidence of how silly\\nBullinger\\'s exegisis was, which stated that the word for \"field\" in Matthew\\n(ie: agros) is different from the word for \"field\" in Acts (ie: chorion), and\\nthus we must be talking about two different fields (Of course you already\\nadmit how stupid Bullinger\\'s exegisis is, but this was a small serendipity\\nwhich drives the point home). \\n\\nSo as of now, unless Mr DeCenso show compelling reasons to believe otherwise\\n(eg: a reputable scholar with reputable references), I consider this \\nparticular issue closed.  See Mr DeCenso, now you can go on to answer\\nquestions about the denials of Peter, the day of the Crucifixion, Tyre, and \\nthe fact that the author of Matthew quoted from the wrong prophet in\\ndiscussing the \"Potter\\'s Field.\"\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLater,\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDave Butler\\n\\n    Precise knowledge is the only true knowledge, and he who does not teach\\n    exactly, does not teach at all.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHenry Ward Beecher\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAmerican Clergyman\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tas recorded by George Seldes\\n',\n",

It was the religion of the great Persian\\nEmpire under kings Cyrus and Darius.  And tradition says that when Christ\\nwas born about 500 years later, he was honored by a visit from three\\nZoroastrian priests, the Magi.  Scholars say many key beliefs of Christians,\\nJews and Muslims can be traced to the teachings of Zoroaster, the\\nZoroastrian prophet.\\n\\n   Yet, with only about 150,000 Zoroastrians in the entire world, they are \\na miniscule minority in every country in which they live.  Survival as a\\npeople is very much on their minds.\\n\\n   Ironically, local Zoroastrians fear that the almost unlimited tolerance\\nof the United States may do what hundreds of years of persecution followed\\nby nearly 1,000 years of benign religious segregation could not do: cause\\ntheir young people to stop thinking of themselves as Zoroastrians.\\n\\n   Zoroastrians do not believe theirs is the only right religion, and they\\nactually shun the notion of trying to win converts.  So if their children\\nbecome totally assimilated, they say, it\\'s their children - rather than\\nthe world at large - who will be the losers.\\n\\n   \"It\\'s important to have an identity,\" said Maneck Bhujwaia of San Jose,\\na leader among Zoroastrians who came here from India.  \"It\\'s important\\nfor everybody - Irish, Scottish, Americans.  It gives meaning to life.\\nYou don\\'t have to depend on the majority community to give you respect.\\nYou can fall back on your own identity.\"\\n\\n   For Zoroastrians, there\\'s much to be proud of.\\n\\n   Their prophet, Zoroaster, seeking to make sense of a culture in which\\nanimal sacrifice to multiple gods was common, preached that there was\\nonly one god, a good one.  Zoroastrians call their god Ahura Mazda, which\\ntranslates as Lord of Wisdom and Light.\\n\\n_Good vs. evil_\\n\\n   Zoroaster saw life as a constant struggle between good and evil, with\\nthe good eventually winning.  Men and women could join in the battle for\\ngood, he said, and he warned that they would inevitably suffer consequences\\nsuch as shame and sorrow if they did wrong.  He preached honesty, charity,\\nkindness to animals, respect for the environment, hard work, equality of\\nmen and women - basic virtues preached by prophets of many religions.\\n\\n   But Zoroaster was perhaps unusual in that he told his followers not to\\nfollow him blindly.  He demanded they think for themselves.  In fact,\\nJoseph Campbell, the famous scholar of the history and meaning of myths,\\ntraced the Western emphasis on individual thought to the Zoroastrians.\\n\\n   Zoroastrians have many words for thought.  Their motto, leaded into a\\nstained glass window over the sacred fire at the temple on the slopes of\\nMount Hamilton, is \"Good thoughts, good words, good deeds.\"\\n\\n   So it\\'s not surprising that Zoroastrians value education highly.  In India,\\nwhere a contingent of Zoroastrians arrived in the ninth century to escape\\npersecution by Muslims in Iran, Zoroastrians claim 100 percent literacy;\\nthe overall statistic in India is just 60 percent.\\n\\n   About half of the Bay Area Zoroastrian community came here from India\\nand Pakistan, mostly to study at universities.  The other half fled from\\nIran after the 1979 revolution made that a fundamentalist Islamic state\\nwhere others had no rights.\\n\\n   Local Zoroastrians point with pride to ways their emphasis on \"good\\ndeeds\" has improved life in every country they inhabit.  In San Jose,\\nthe recent restoration of the Hotel Sainte Clarie came about because\\nManou Mobedshahi, a San Francisco-based hotelier, passed the boarded-up\\ndowntown landmark on his way to and from the temple.  At the temple\\'s\\ndedication, the chief guest of honor was the mother of Zubin Mehta, the\\nZoroastrian conductor of the New York Philharmonic Orchestra.\\n\\n   The temple exists because of another good deed: the decision by an\\nIranian emigre, the late Arbab Rustom Guiv, to buy land for six temples\\nin North America.  Besides the 10-acre site off Crothers Road on Mount\\nHamilton, he paid for land in Los Angeles, Chicago, New York, Toronto,\\nand Vancouver.  Until his gifts, there were no Zoroastrian temples on\\nthis continent.\\n\\n   Local Zoroastrians raised money to build the actual temple, and the\\nproperty already had a large house that they have converted to a\\ncommunity center.\\n\\n   The temple, dedicated a year ago on the birthday of the prophet \\nZoroaster, is a simple structure with gleaming white walls, vaulted \\nceilings and oak floors, partially covered with huge Oriental carpets.\\n\\n   Its central feature is the fire, set in the middle of a partly-glassed-\\nin area at the center of the building.  Although Zoroastrians are \\nsometimes called \"fire worshippers,\" they actually consider fire just \\na symbol of God.  \"It helps us concentrate, just like Christians use the \\ncross and Muslims use the Holy Book,\" Bhujwala said.\\n\\n   The biggest celebration of the years occurs in early spring.  For all\\nIranians, including Zoroastrians, the New Year begins on the first day of\\nthe season because of its symbolism as the start of new life.  With\\nZoroaster\\'s birthday just six days later, the combination of religious\\nand secular holidays creates something on par with what most of the\\nUnited States celebrates between Christmas and Jan. 1.\\n\\n  For this year\\'s celebration of the prophet\\'s birthday, about 500 people\\ncame to worship and revel.\\n\\n   \"The good things in life are not forbidden,\" Esfandiar Anoushiravani,\\na leader of the Iranian members, had said beforehand, and what followed\\nproved him right.\\n\\n   Inside the temple, worshipers filled every chair and sat or stood\\naround the edges of the room as about a half-dozen priests chanted\\nthanksgiving prayers around a table laden with braziers of smoking\\nsandalwood, glasses of milk and water, and a tray heaped with dried fruit\\nand nuts.\\n\\n   Kids crowded around, grabbing handfuls of the treats.  \"People eat the\\nfruit,\" Tarapore said.  \"It\\'s a way to participate in the ceremony.\"\\n\\n_Santa Claus, sort of_\\n\\n   The gathering even had a Santa Claus, Iranian style.  With flowing white\\nhair and a bag of gifts for the children, this Amownaroz wore green\\nsymbolic of spring) and red.\\n\\n   He was ushed in by a sort of spring clown, Hajefyrouz, who danced and\\nplayed a tambourine.\\n\\n   The Zoroastrians from India were charmed.  \"This is all new for us, too,\"\\none told a visitor who asked what was going on.\\n\\n   A visitor, John A. Sabanovich of Folsom, said he became intrigued with\\nthe religion years ago while on business trips to Iran.  Zoroastrians have\\nno procedure for accepting converts - a result, some say, of their\\ncenturies of persecution in Iran followed by their promise to the Hindu\\nking who allowed them into India that they would not interfere with his\\npeople\\'s religion.\\n\\n   But that does not stop Sabavich from joining in the celebrations at the\\nSan Jose temple whenever he can.\\n\\n   \"When I first heard about this religion,\" he said, \"I thought, my God,\\nthis is what a religion should be.  They think for themselves and do good.\\n\\n   \"People who don\\'t have a tradition, something to lean on, what\\'s the\\ndifference with the lower animals?\"\\n\\n------------------------------------------------ end of article ---- \\n',\n",

In this\\nwork, Swinburne attempts to construct a series of inductive arguments for the\\nexistence of God.  His arguments, which are somewhat tendentious and rely\\nupon the imputation of late 20th century western Christian values and\\naesthetics to a God which is supposedly as simple as can be conceived, were\\ndecisively rejected in Mackie\\'s \"The Miracle of Theism\".

It also addresses those\\npositions which push the concept of God beyond the realm of the rational,\\nsuch as those of Kierkegaard, Kung and Philips, as well as \"replacements for\\nGod\" such as Lelie\\'s axiarchism.

What does it mean to be \\'Tao\\'d\\'?\\n\\nIt seems to me that these questions more properly fall into the\\ncategory of \"general metaphysics\". I would prefer any misc.taoism\\nto deal more closely with topics and works more closely associated\\nwith at least \"semi-orthodox\" Taoism: with established classic works \\ndefinitely included and works like Mantak Chia\\'s argued about! \\n\\nI think \"neo-Taoism\" should be excluded or get its own group (what I\\nmean by this is \"Humpty-Dumpty Taoism\", in which Taoism means whatever \\na poster says it means.) This \"alt.taoism\" could also be a refuge \\nfor debates about what \"Taoism *REALLY* means\" or speculations on sexual\\nalchemy, etc..\\n\\ne.g. (from Thyagi again):\\n> Taoism does what the hell it wants, I tell you.\\n> Taoism doesn\\'t exist.  \\'Taoism\\' is no more real that \\'Tao\\'.  Decide, now.\\n> Real or not real?  Exist or not-exist?  When shall we be certain\\n\\nKent gloomily predicts (quoting from Thyagi\\'s article):\\n\\n> However most traffic in \\n> the group will likely concern the philosophical, secular taoism\\n> averred by Alan Watts and Niels Bohr, and yogic taoism as it pertains\\n> to medical, sexual and martial techniques.\\n\\nI think that discussions of this nature are not completely out of\\nplace. What\\'s happening is that that the term \"Taoism\" is becoming\\ncompletely polluted and trivialized like the words \"magic\", \"Alchemy\", \\n\"Zen,\" etc., by writers appropriating the word to mean whatever they \\nwant. This is seen by the spate of new age books entitled \"The\\nTao of\" this, that, and everything else. (With respect to some exceptions\\nlike the books by Jou, Tsung-Hwa.)\\n\\nAny other comments/ideas? I look forward to seeing them. On balance,\\nI say let misc.taoism rip and let the chips fall where they may. If\\nit just gets filled up with college freshmen asking about the\\nTao of Sex then it will have been a failure and people will post to\\nthese groups just as they do now.\\n\\n-- \\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nTim P.

Did Jesus\\nchange that?\\n\\n: If anything, He clarified the Law such as in that quote you made.  In the\\n: following verses, Jesus takes several portions of the Law and expounds upon\\n: the Law giving clearer meaning to what God intended.\\n\\nSure he does this.  However, he doesn\\'t address the notion of stoning\\nnon-virgin brides, because this needs no clarification.  Are you going to\\ndeny that Deuteronomy 22:20-25 is not patently clear in its intent?\\n\\n: I think you will agree with me that there are in today\\'s world, a lot of\\n: modern-day Pharisees who know the bible from end to end but do not believe\\n: in it.  What good is head knowledge if there is nothing in the heart?\\n\\nI\\'ll agree that there is a lot of modern day Pharisees that know the Bible\\nfrom end to end and don\\'t believe in it.  Depending on how they use this\\nknowledge, they can be scary.  They can argue any position they desire, and\\nback it up with selected parts of the Bible.  Such Pharisees include David\\nKoresh and Adolph Hitler.  I will qualify this by saying *I don\\'t know* if\\nthey actually believed what they were preaching, but the ends certainly\\nmade the means look frightening.\\n\\nHowever, just as scary are those that don\\'t know much of the Bible, but\\nbelieve every word.  In fact, this is probably scarier, since there are far\\nmore of these people, from what I\\'ve seen.  In addition, they are very easy\\nto manipulate by the aforementioned Pharisees, since they don\\'t know enough\\nto debate with these people.\\n\\n: Christianity is not just a set of rules; it\\'s a lifestyle that changes one\\'s\\n: perspectives and personal conduct.  And it demands obedience to God\\'s will.\\n\\nNo, it demands obedience to a book.  If God came down and personally told\\nme how I should behave, then I would say that I would be doing God\\'s will\\nby doing it.  However, if preachers, pastors, and evangelists tell me to\\nobey the will of a book written by people who have been dead for close to\\ntwo millenia (even longer for the OT), even if I follow everything in it\\nwith my heart, I could scarcely be honest with myself by saying I\\'m doing\\nthe will of God.\\n\\n: Some people can live by it, but many others cannot or will not.  That is\\n: their choice and I have to respect it because God respects it too.\\n\\nWell, if God respects it so much, how come there is talk in the Bible about\\neternal damnation for non-believers?

The split\\nbetween the train and test set is based upon a messages posted before\\nand after a specific date.\\n\\nThis module contains two loaders.

The target\\nattribute is the integer index of the category::\\n\\n  >>> newsgroups_train.filenames.shape\\n  (11314,)\\n  >>> newsgroups_train.target.shape\\n  (11314,)\\n  >>> newsgroups_train.target[:10]\\n  array([ 7,  4,  4,  1, 14, 16, 13,  3,  2,  4])\\n\\nIt is possible to load only a sub-selection of the categories by passing the\\nlist of the categories to load to the\\n:func:`sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups` function::\\n\\n  >>> cats = [\\'alt.atheism\\', \\'sci.space\\']\\n  >>> newsgroups_train = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'train\\', categories=cats)\\n\\n  >>> list(newsgroups_train.target_names)\\n  [\\'alt.atheism\\', \\'sci.space\\']\\n  >>> newsgroups_train.filenames.shape\\n  (1073,)\\n  >>> newsgroups_train.target.shape\\n  (1073,)\\n  >>> newsgroups_train.target[:10]\\n  array([0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0])\\n\\nConverting text to vectors\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nIn order to feed predictive or clustering models with the text data,\\none first need to turn the text into vectors of numerical values suitable\\nfor statistical analysis.

Many classifiers achieve very\\nhigh F-scores, but their results would not generalize to other documents that\\naren\\'t from this window of time.\\n\\nFor example, let\\'s look at the results of a multinomial Naive Bayes classifier,\\nwhich is fast to train and achieves a decent F-score::\\n\\n  >>> from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB\\n  >>> from sklearn import metrics\\n  >>> newsgroups_test = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'test\\',\\n  ...                                      categories=categories)\\n  >>> vectors_test = vectorizer.transform(newsgroups_test.data)\\n  >>> clf = MultinomialNB(alpha=.01)\\n  >>> clf.fit(vectors, newsgroups_train.target)\\n  MultinomialNB(alpha=0.01, class_prior=None, fit_prior=True)\\n\\n  >>> pred = clf.predict(vectors_test)\\n  >>> metrics.f1_score(newsgroups_test.target, pred, average=\\'macro\\')  # doctest: +ELLIPSIS\\n  0.88213...\\n\\n(The example :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_text_plot_document_classification_20newsgroups.py` shuffles\\nthe training and test data, instead of segmenting by time, and in that case\\nmultinomial Naive Bayes gets a much higher F-score of 0.88. Are you suspicious\\nyet of what\\'s going on inside this classifier?)\\n\\nLet\\'s take a look at what the most informative features are:\\n\\n  >>> import numpy as np\\n  >>> def show_top10(classifier, vectorizer, categories):\\n  ...     feature_names = np.asarray(vectorizer.get_feature_names())\\n  ...     for i, category in enumerate(categories):\\n  ...         top10 = np.argsort(classifier.coef_[i])[-10:]\\n  ...         print(\"%s: %s\" % (category, \" \".join(feature_names[top10])))\\n  ...\\n  >>> show_top10(clf, vectorizer, newsgroups_train.target_names)\\n  alt.atheism: edu it and in you that is of to the\\n  comp.graphics: edu in graphics it is for and of to the\\n  sci.space: edu it that is in and space to of the\\n  talk.religion.misc: not it you in is that and to of the\\n\\n\\nYou can now see many things that these features have overfit to:\\n\\n- Almost every group is distinguished by whether headers such as\\n  ``NNTP-Posting-Host:`` and ``Distribution:`` appear more or less often.\\n- Another significant feature involves whether the sender is affiliated with\\n  a university, as indicated either by their headers or their signature.\\n- The word \"article\" is a significant feature, based on how often people quote\\n  previous posts like this: \"In article [article ID], [name] <[e-mail address]>\\n  wrote:\"\\n- Other features match the names and e-mail addresses of particular people who\\n  were posting at the time.\\n\\nWith such an abundance of clues that distinguish newsgroups, the classifiers\\nbarely have to identify topics from text at all, and they all perform at the\\nsame high level.\\n\\nFor this reason, the functions that load 20 Newsgroups data provide a\\nparameter called **remove**, telling it what kinds of information to strip out\\nof each file. **remove** should be a tuple containing any subset of\\n``(\\'headers\\', \\'footers\\', \\'quotes\\')``, telling it to remove headers, signature\\nblocks, and quotation blocks respectively.\\n\\n  >>> newsgroups_test = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'test\\',\\n  ...                                      remove=(\\'headers\\', \\'footers\\', \\'quotes\\'),\\n  ...                                      categories=categories)\\n  >>> vectors_test = vectorizer.transform(newsgroups_test.data)\\n  >>> pred = clf.predict(vectors_test)\\n  >>> metrics.f1_score(pred, newsgroups_test.target, average=\\'macro\\')  # doctest: +ELLIPSIS\\n  0.77310...\\n\\nThis classifier lost over a lot of its F-score, just because we removed\\nmetadata that has little to do with topic classification.\\nIt loses even more if we also strip this metadata from the training data:\\n\\n  >>> newsgroups_train = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'train\\',\\n  ...                                       remove=(\\'headers\\', \\'footers\\', \\'quotes\\'),\\n  ...                                       categories=categories)\\n  >>> vectors = vectorizer.fit_transform(newsgroups_train.data)\\n  >>> clf = MultinomialNB(alpha=.01)\\n  >>> clf.fit(vectors, newsgroups_train.target)\\n  MultinomialNB(alpha=0.01, class_prior=None, fit_prior=True)\\n\\n  >>> vectors_test = vectorizer.transform(newsgroups_test.data)\\n  >>> pred = clf.predict(vectors_test)\\n  >>> metrics.f1_score(newsgroups_test.target, pred, average=\\'macro\\')  # doctest: +ELLIPSIS\\n  0.76995...\\n\\nSome other classifiers cope better with this harder version of the task.
